<p class="center">THE SPRUCE STREET MURDER.</p>


<p>"Hark! I thought I heard the outside door
open and shut."</p>

<p>"No, it was nothing."</p>

<p>"Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"Quite sure, Seth."</p>

<p>"What time is it now, Spicer?"</p>

<p>"Half-past seven."</p>

<p>"Half-past seven, and George not here yet!"</p>

<p>"He don't seem to have shown up, that's a fact."</p>

<p>"What can be keeping the fellow?"</p>

<p>"There you've got me, Seth. He's usually prompt
enough, you know."</p>

<p>"That's so, old man; but I tell you what, if we're
going to take hold of this case at all, we ought to
be getting to work."</p>

<p>"I fully agree with you, and am most anxious
not to lose the next Eastern-bound train."</p>

<p>"Confound it. I wish George would come. I
don't want the regular men to get in ahead of us."</p>

<p>"It isn't that that I care so much about," said
Old Spicer, quietly; "but I <i>do</i> hate to see a good
case all muddled up."</p>

<p>"And so do I," exclaimed Stricket. "It makes
me mad even now when I think of the way they
managed such splendid cases as the Jennie Cramer,
Rose Ambler, and half a dozen others like them."</p>

<p>"Did you hear who was going over to Stony
Creek this morning?"</p>

<p>"Only Willett, so far as I could learn; and perhaps
Medical Examiner Gaylord, of Branford."</p>

<p>"Well, I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hark! what's that? The outside door this time,
eh?"</p>

<p>"You're right; he's come at last. Yes, that's
George Morgan's footstep." Then, as some one
knocked at the door of the room, "Come in, George,"
and a young man of some twenty-six or twenty-seven
years entered.</p>

<p>"I'm glad to see you, George," continued the old
detective, as the new-comer sank wearily into an
arm-chair; "but I should have been better pleased
to have welcomed you half an hour earlier."</p>

<p>"Yes," exclaimed Seth Stricket, quickly; "for
goodness' sake, what's kept you, George?"</p>

<p>"My excuse for not being on time is a good one,"
responded George Morgan, gravely. "If it were
not so, I think you both know me well enough to
believe I wouldn't have occasion to offer any."</p>

<p>"I am sure of that," nodded Old Spicer.</p>

<p>"And so am I," added Seth; "but let's hear it all
the same."</p>

<p>"Well, you know it was agreed among us, before
we parted last night, that I should see Chief Bollmann
before joining you this morning."</p>

<p>"Yes, that was the arrangement," assented Old
Spicer.</p>

<p>"Of course, he wouldn't be at his office in the police
building as early as six o'clock."</p>

<p>"Not likely," laughed Stricket.</p>

<p>"So, knowing that," continued George, "I started
at once for his residence, No. 40 Sylvan Avenue."</p>

<p>His two listeners nodded.</p>

<p>"I went out George Street, expecting to turn off
either before, or at least when, I reached York, but
was so busy with my own thoughts that I had
crossed York and was well on toward Spruce before
I knew it."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"When I came to myself and saw where I was, I
turned into Spruce Street, and walked toward
Oak."</p>

<p>"For Heaven's sake, George," exclaimed Stricket,
impatiently, "where are you driving to? Do get to
Sylvan Avenue some time this morning."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I can't do that, Seth," replied the
young man, with a grave smile; "but I am getting
to the meat of my story, and to my excuse, pretty
fast now."</p>

<p>"Let's have it then."</p>

<p>"Do you remember what used to be, and what is
still called by some, the Turn Hall, on Spruce
Street?"</p>

<p>"I do, very well," said Stricket. "The property
belongs to old Mother Ernst, and she keeps a saloon&mdash;a
fearfully low place&mdash;in the basement."</p>

<p>"You're right in one particular, Seth; it's low
enough, in all conscience&mdash;clean under ground."</p>

<p>"I've heard of the woman," said Old Spicer.
"She lives and sleeps in that low basement; in
fact, it is said, she hardly ever shows herself above
ground nowadays."</p>

<p>"That's true," affirmed Stricket; "she's seventy-two
or -three years old, and she's lived in that
damp basement so long, she's got the rheumatism
the worst way, so that she can hardly waddle&mdash;has
to use a cane."</p>

<p>"Well," continued George, "a milk-wagon was
standing in front of the house, and just as I arrived
abreast of the place, the milkman, Julius Smith, of
East Haven, came rushing up the outside basement
steps, his face as white as a sheet, his eyes bulging
from their sockets, and his hair, so far as I could
see it, fairly standing on end.</p>

<p>"'I say, my man, what's the matter with you?'
I demanded, seizing him by the arm, and giving
him a shake to start up his ideas a little.</p>

<p>"'Matter? matter?' he gasped; 'matter enough&mdash;murder's
the matter!'</p>

<p>"'What's that?' I demanded, sternly; 'what's
that you say, sir?'</p>

<p>"'I say the old woman lies murdered on a
lounge, in her saloon down there,' and he pointed
down the stone steps.</p>

<p>"'What! Mrs. Ernst murdered?' exclaimed a
voice at my side.</p>

<p>"I looked round, and saw that we had been
joined by Henry M. Cohen, the watchmaker; and
in less than a minute more there were at least a
dozen people about us."</p>

<p>"You went into the house, of course, George?"
said Old Spicer, inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Yes; the milkman, Cohen, and I entered the
room where the dead body was stretched on the
sofa."</p>

<p>"You got a good look at it, then, before it was
disturbed?"</p>

<p>"Yes, when we first entered the old woman was
lying on her left side, with her face to the wall."</p>

<p>"Had she been dead long, do you think?"</p>

<p>"Some hours, I should say&mdash;five or six, at least."</p>

<p>"Why do you think so?"</p>

<p>"I felt of her limbs; they were as cold as a
stone."</p>

<p>"Had she been shot or stabbed?"</p>

<p>"Neither. Suffocated or chloroformed, it seemed
to me."</p>

<p>"Was she bound and gagged?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; her hands were tied together at the
wrists with an ordinary pocket handkerchief. Her
heavy woolen-stockinged feet were also tied together;
another handkerchief encircled her shins.
Around her throat and head was wrapped a sheet.
That part of it which encircled the neck made a
bandage so tight that it must have stopped her
breathing soon after it was put into use. Her mouth
was partially filled with another handkerchief."</p>

<p>"Hum," mused Old Spicer, "the murderers were
well supplied with handkerchiefs, it seems."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; and of this last one&mdash;the gag&mdash;I shall
have more to say by and by. The ends of it so fell
across her breast that, I should think, in her desperate
struggle to breathe, she had probably forced
the larger part of the handkerchief from her
mouth."</p>

<p>"Were there no signs of blood?"</p>

<p>"There were a few drops on this very handkerchief,
evidently from her nose; and I thought I discovered
a bruise and a little blood on the back of her
head."</p>

<p>"Then there had been something of a scuffle?"</p>

<p>"Well, as to that I can't exactly say. A superficial
examination of the hands and head of the dead
woman revealed no other signs indicative of a struggle
or blows. Even at her throat, where generally,
you know, finger-nail imprints are to be found on a
person who has been strangled to death, there were
no such confirmatory evidences of a struggle."</p>

<p>"How was she dressed, George?" asked Stricket.</p>

<p>"The clothes she had on," Cohen said, "were
those she usually appeared in when at home."</p>

<p>"Were they disarranged in any way?"</p>

<p>"That portion of her attire that covered her breast
had been torn apart, and a search made presumably
for a pocket-book or a roll of bank bills which
was believed to be secreted there."</p>

<p>"Ah-ha!" exclaimed Stricket, "the job must
have been done by some one who knew the old
woman, for there's where she always carried a good
share of her money."</p>

<p>"That's not conclusive," said Old Spicer, with a
shake of the head. "It's a well-known fact that
many women carry their purses under the bosom of
their dress."</p>

<p>"Yes," said George, "I've had occasion to notice
that myself."</p>

<p>"Well," said Stricket, who was very much interested,
"go on. What else did you notice?"</p>

<p>"I saw one of her great heavy black slippers on
the floor at the foot of the sofa; the mate was on the
right foot. On the sofa, alongside the dead body,
was a black walking-stick."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Stricket, "that has been her constant
companion for the past fifteen years. Without it
she couldn't have hobbled across her saloon."</p>

<p>"Were the rooms themselves very much disturbed?"
asked Old Spicer.</p>

<p>"If the whole basement and its contents had been
lifted right up and then scattered by a cyclone it
could not have been in a more confused condition.
I tell you, gentlemen, a house and its contents were
never more thoroughly ransacked. Why, the solitary
bedroom, where Cohen said Mrs. Ernst had
slept for the past quarter of a century, was actually
turned inside out. The bedtick was ripped open,
and what it inclosed had been very industriously
examined.</p>

<p>"The murderer or murderers made pretty thorough
work of it, eh?" said Stricket, inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Of the bed?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"From the way they went through it, Seth, I have
precious little doubt they had good reason to believe
the old woman had a big pile of money hid in the
stuffing of that ticking."</p>

<p>"Oh-ho! and do you think they found it?"</p>

<p>"They may have found some, but not enough to
satisfy them."</p>

<p>"How do you know that?"</p>

<p>"From the way they went at the rest of the furniture.
For instance, one of those queer, old-fashioned
bureaus, such as the hunter for the antique
delights to discover, stood in the bedroom.
Every drawer of it had been rifled, and the various
articles, none of which appeared to be very valuable,
strewed the floor.</p>

<p>"Any other piece of furniture that seemed to be
a receptacle for hidden wealth of the occupant of
the basement was completely overhauled. In the
front room not a box, or a bundle, or a drawer, or a
pail, or a corner was overlooked by the greedy eyes
of the criminals. They meant business, I can tell
you."</p>

<p>"Were any of the regular authorities on the
ground before you came away?" asked Old Spicer,
suddenly.</p>

<p>"Yes, the coroner, a police captain, and two or
three detectives were there."</p>

<p>"Have they any idea who did the deed?"</p>

<p>"Not the slightest; they are completely at sea."</p>

<p>"Have you formed any theory yourself, George?"</p>

<p>"Well, to confess the truth, I have, sir."</p>

<p>"Let's hear it."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, sir, but I should like to hear
your opinion before I venture to express mine."</p>

<p>Old Spicer was silent for a moment, then he
abruptly exclaimed:</p>

<p>"I should like to visit the scene of this tragedy.
Suppose we go to Spruce Street at once, gentlemen."</p>

<p>"What! and give up the Stony Creek affair?" exclaimed
Stricket, in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Not necessarily," was the reply.</p>

<p>"But I don't understand, Mark."</p>

<p>"I have an idea," rejoined Old Spicer, quietly,
"that in this instance, the shortest road to Stony
Creek lies through Spruce Street."</p>

<p>"Thunder!" ejaculated George Morgan, "I believe
you are right."</p>

<p>"Come, then, let us be off at once," and a moment
later the three detectives left the house.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<p class="center">OLD SPICER VISITS THE SCENE OF THE MURDER.</p>


<p>The conversation related in the preceding chapter
had occurred in the back parlor of Old Spicer's residence
in Home Place.</p>

<p>The great detective, who had now owned and occupied
this house for some time, had fitted it up to
suit his own fancy and convenience.</p>

<p>He resided there alone&mdash;that is, so far as family
was concerned, for Mrs. Hettie Catlin, the widow
of Frederic Catlin, was still his housekeeper, and
they kept one servant-of-all-work, a middle-aged
woman, upon whom the detective could thoroughly
rely.</p>

<p>The back parlor looked out upon a small garden,
and this room Old Spicer had chosen for his <i>sanctum
sanctorum</i>, and furnished it accordingly.</p>

<p>It would have been a feast, even for the great
Lecoq, to have been able to pay a visit to this retreat.
The wonders and trophies it contained were
legion, and furnished a history in epitome of all the
cases Old Spicer had ever had a hand in.</p>

<p>Naturally the old man loved this room, and spent
as much of his time in it as possible.</p>

<p>He had many friends, but few intimates. Those
few, however, he delighted to receive within the
sacred precincts of the back parlor, and for this reason
George Morgan, his adopted son, had recently
purchased a beautiful residence on Academy Street,
the garden of which ran down to and adjoined the
old detective's little yard, and between which the
means of communication was a gate in the garden
fence.</p>

<p>Seth Stricket, too, had taken up his residence in
the neighborhood, having moved into a pretty cottage
on Green Street, and thus Old Spicer had his
two most reliable assistants close at hand.</p>

<p>On reaching the sidewalk the trio passed out of
Home Place, crossed Olive Street, entered Court,
and keeping on, soon arrived at the police building.</p>

<p>Here they stopped, and entering the office, made
such inquiries of the officer in charge as Spicer
deemed expedient.</p>

<p>Chief Bollmann was not there, neither were any
of the prominent members of the detective force;
they were over in Spruce Street and otherwheres,
working on the new murder case.</p>

<p>Old Spicer determined to lose no more time; so,
leaving the headquarters of the police, he and his
friends walked to Church Street, where they hailed
a carriage, and were swiftly driven to the dead
woman's house.</p>

<p>George Morgan led the way down the blue stone
steps to the basement, where the murder had been
committed, and Old Spicer at once began to examine
the place where the widow had made her home
for so many years.</p>

<p>The building was quite a large one, and, as he
knew, had been, in the early history of the Turn
Verein in the city, a meeting place for that body.</p>

<p>It was two stories high above the basement, and
divided into six tenements, all of which were occupied.</p>

<p>But it was the basement itself that interested Old
Spicer most, and as he wandered about it he was
forced to admit that it was a veritable Chinese puzzle.</p>

<p>The main apartment was, of course, the barroom,
where for years Mrs. Ernst, and two of her three
husbands before her, had sold beer and liquor.</p>

<p>The chief informed Spicer that up to the present
year the widow had carried on the saloon business
there under the usual authority. She had not, however,
he said, renewed her license for the present
year, although she expected to do so before the summer
season set in. She was a dispenser, since her
license expired, of temperance drinks ostensibly.</p>

<p>Old Spicer and those with him, in looking over
the premises, soon discovered conclusive proof that
she did not strictly interpret the license law. Ale
barrels, beer kegs, and demijohns for whisky and
other fiery liquors were scattered through the basement.</p>

<p>In the rear of the barroom was the bedroom.
There were many more rooms in the basement.
Fourteen inside doors led into the little rooms, each
of which was furnished with one or two chairs, a
lounge, table, and a stove. Most of these rooms
could be reached from two or three different sides.</p>

<p>In the rear were two doors leading to the back
yard, and a covered passage leading to a little alley
through which York Street could be reached. Four
doors opened out of the room where the body of
Mrs. Ernst was discovered by the milkman.</p>

<p>No one who was unfamiliar with the premises
had any idea that there were more than two rooms
in the basement. The officials, Chief Bollmann,
Coroner Mix, and all the detectives, including
Spicer, Stricket and Morgan, who had a pretty good
knowledge of the various haunts of vice in the city,
were surprised to find such a thoroughly mixed-up
piece of underground architecture.</p>

<p>Old Spicer, while inspecting the apartments and
the several dark passages by which the rooms were
reached, compared the surroundings, because of the
abrupt and unexpected halls and turns, the scanty
furnishings, and the like, to some of the celebrated
structures that carried notoriety to the old Five
Points in New York years ago.</p>

<p>In the southeast corner of the basement, where
the uninitiated might expect to find a coal bin or a
hole in the ground to store away wood, they discovered
a room with three or four chairs and a lounge.
Even the tenants on the floor above had no idea that
there was such a room in existence.</p>

<p>One of the passages from the bedroom opened
into what must have been a sort of social apartment
for the patrons of the widow. It might also
answer the purpose of a card or smoking-room. A
cheap stove, a couple of tables, and three or four
chairs comprised the furniture of this room.</p>

<p>Then there was discovered another apartment
which was probably used as a storehouse for ale and
beer barrels. Besides these there were found a
woodshed and tool-room, and a suspicious looking
trap-door that covered what Old Spicer was privately
informed was a secret underground tunnel that extended
far in the rear of the building.</p>

<p>He raised the heavy door and looked in; the entrance
was nearly choked up with ashes.</p>

<p>He removed some of the rubbish with his foot,
and peered eagerly into the black darkness. The
hole had a mysterious look about it, and he could
not but regard it with strong suspicion.</p>

<p>One of the tenants of the house approached,
pointed to the black opening, mysteriously shrugged
his shoulders, shook his head, and then mumbled,
in what he meant to be a confidential tone:</p>

<p>"That there underground passage leads clear
across the back-yard, Mister Detective; and just
let me tell you it'll be a mighty interesting thoroughfare
for you to inspect."</p>

<p>"Thoroughfare, eh?" questioned Old Spicer,
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"That's what I said, sir."</p>

<p>"Thank you for the hint, my friend; most likely
I shall act upon it later." Then he closed the trap-door,
and once more turned toward the bar-room.</p>

<p>This apartment was of comfortable dimensions,
and was the principal room in the basement. It
was furnished on the same scale of poverty as the
rest, and the first glimpse into it would not have
been very reassuring to the spectator. The bar
resembled those that bloom in cheap groggeries.</p>

<p>There was an evident purpose on the part of the
owner to keep the public from sharing the brilliancy
of the interior, for a paper screen two and a half
feet high and two feet wide stood at the end of the
bar as a barrier to the glow of an oil lamp that shed
its exclusive light through the gloomy apartment.</p>

<p>A dilapidated, small-sized looking-glass adorned
the partition wall back of the bar. In the tool-room
were a hatchet and a butcher's knife, besides
a bunch of rusty keys.</p>

<p>Suspended from the bar-room wall and right over
the dead woman's head, was a picture of Napoleon
Bonaparte surveying a battlefield with his generals.
A picture of Richard Wagner looked down on the
corpse from another part of the interior.</p>

<p>"When I first came in here this morning with
the milkman," said Morgan, "there were bottles
and half-filled glasses on the bar."</p>

<p>"What was in the glasses?" asked Stricket.</p>

<p>"In one there was nothing but soda-water. The
other contained claret."</p>

<p>"How long was it after you got here before the
police arrived?" asked Old Spicer.</p>

<p>"I had had hardly time enough to take a good
look at the murdered woman when Policeman Cannon,
who resides in the brick block next south of
this, came in. He had only just returned from his
night patrol and lain down. His wife heard the
outcry in the street and aroused him."</p>

<p>"I suppose he assumed authority at once?"</p>

<p>"Why, he found the place pretty well filled by an
excited throng, and men, women and boys making
excursions through the several apartments; but before
he could clear out the people, Detective Reilly
arrived."</p>

<p>"Ah! somebody telephoned to headquarters, I
suppose?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so, for very soon the coroner came
rushing in, then Detective Brewer made his appearance
in hot haste; and finally Chief Bollmann, Policeman
Hyde and other officers."</p>

<p>"By that time there was a scattering, I fancy,"
said Stricket, with a smile.</p>

<p>"Yes," assented George, "everybody was hunted
from the basement except those you see here now."</p>

<p>At this moment Coroner Mix joined them.</p>

<p>"Going to look into this case a little, Old Spicer?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"I have some thoughts of doing so," was the
reply.</p>

<p>"I hope you will," said the coroner. "If there
is any information I can give you, I will impart it
gladly."</p>

<p>"Are there any clews to work on as yet?" asked
Old Spicer.</p>

<p>"Very few, so far as I have been able to learn."</p>

<p>"What do you know about the woman, anyway?"</p>

<p>"Very little indeed. The fact is, Spicer, there
seems to be a blissful ignorance on every hand, even
regarding the history of the victim and her family
affairs."</p>

<p>"Ah-ha! she kept her family affairs to herself,
did she?"</p>

<p>"It seems so. A mystery looms up at the very
outset of the case. But of that hereafter."</p>

<p>"All right, the mystery can wait, if you say so.
But with regard to her relatives, surely something
is known about them. What have you been able to
find out?"</p>

<p>"In the first place, I have ascertained that Mrs.
Ernst had been in this country between thirty and
forty years, coming from Germany; and that her
financial manager, for a long time past, was Maier
Zunder."</p>

<p>"She was a widow, I believe?"</p>

<p>"Yes, a good deal of a widow. She had been
married three times, and her three husbands are
dead."</p>

<p>"Indeed?"</p>

<p>"Yes; the first died in Germany."</p>

<p>"What was his name?"</p>

<p>"George Pfaff. After his death she came to the
United States and met her second husband, Franz
Natolph, in New York."</p>

<p>"He came to New Haven with her, didn't he?"
asked Stricket.</p>

<p>"Yes," was the reply, "and they started in the
saloon-business in this very place."</p>

<p>"There was a pretty serious row, wasn't there, in
which Natolph got hurt?"</p>

<p>"Yes, one night, in this very room, Natolph was
struck in the head with a bottle, nearly cracking
his skull. Typhoid fever set in, and that and the
injuries from the bottle soon after caused his
death."</p>

<p>"How long is it since Ernst, her third husband,
died?" asked Old Spicer.</p>

<p>"Less than ten years," was the reply.</p>

<p>"She left no children, I believe?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;never had any, so far as I have been
able to learn."</p>

<p>"She has kept up the business, married or single?"</p>

<p>"Yes: to the very hour of her death."</p>

<p>Old Spicer glanced at the dead body on the
sofa.</p>

<p>"She was a very stout woman," he remarked,
"but, I believe, was not in good health."</p>

<p>"No," answered the coroner, "she has been
troubled of late years with a severe asthmatic attack.
She was rarely seen outside of this basement,
for a flight of stairs was a terror to her."</p>

<p>"She suffered from rheumatism, I have been
told."</p>

<p>"Yes, fearfully; it settled in her limbs, and caused
a lameness, which was relieved somewhat by the assistance
of the black walking-stick you see by her
side."</p>

<p>"But she did go out sometimes?"</p>

<p>"Only at rare intervals, and then always in a carriage."</p>

<p>"She was quite well off&mdash;rich, in fact?"</p>

<p>"Of late years she has been increasing her wealth
pretty fast. She owns this house, and the large
brick block directly back of it, which fronts on
York Street."</p>

<p>"She was mighty close-fisted," observed Stricket.</p>

<p>"Yes," assented the coroner, "she was of a parsimonious
disposition, and by some in this neighborhood
was called very grasping and miserly."</p>

<p>"It seems to me the chief ought to know something
about her affairs," remarked Stricket, in a
musing tone; "for, if I remember rightly, he was
employed by her years ago, when he was practicing
law."</p>

<p>"You are right, Mr. Stricket," assented the coroner,
"years ago he was her counsel, but only, as he
informs me, on two or three occasions."</p>

<p>At that moment the chief and several other officials
joined them. As they seemed very willing to
talk, Old Spicer determined to be a listener, and very
sparing of his own words.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

<p class="center">OLD SPICER BEGINS AN INVESTIGATION.</p>


<p>"What do you think of the case, Spicer?" asked
the chief, carelessly.</p>

<p>"I have formed no decided opinion as yet," was
the reply, "have you?"</p>

<p>"Well," rejoined the chief, "I am beginning to
map out a theory."</p>

<p>"I should like to hear it," said Spicer.</p>

<p>"I have no objection to giving you my ideas," returned
Bollmann, "you see of late, the old woman
had become more grasping than ever. She didn't
care who came here so long as they left plenty of
money behind them, and there's no doubt of it, the
greater part of those who frequented the place were
a pretty tough set."</p>

<p>"That's evident, I think."</p>

<p>"Yes, young men and young women have been
frequently seen in this basement, whose hilarity
was so violent at times during the night that the
upper tenants were more or less disturbed. We infer,
too, from what we have seen of the series of
rooms we have stumbled upon, that they were not
for the accommodation of the most law-abiding of
our citizens."</p>

<p>"You think, then, this murder was committed by
some of the dead woman's patrons?"</p>

<p>"I think that may be the case."</p>

<p>"And you will shape your investigation accordingly?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and our first move will be to find out who
was here last night."</p>

<p>"Have you made any progress in that direction?"</p>

<p>"One of the tenants of the house&mdash;Otto Webber&mdash;who
will remove from here in a day or two, came
into the basement last night, about 8.30, to tell Mrs.
Ernst he was about to vacate his apartments. He
had with him Alexander Lane and Andrew Lane,
brothers, who live on Congress Avenue. Andrew
is to rent the tenement to be vacated by Webber.
The latter introduced the widow to him. While
they were talking, the sound of female voices and
those of a couple of men reached them, from one of
the little back rooms."</p>

<p>"Ah-ha! did Webber catch a glimpse of them?"</p>

<p>"No, he did not see any of the party; neither did
his companions. But, Spicer, my men are hunting
for that quartet."</p>

<p>"So?"</p>

<p>"Yes, just so."</p>

<p>"What else have you to go by?"</p>

<p>"A woman in the brick block which the widow
owned, just back of this and fronting on York
Street, looked from a rear window, last night, and
saw a light burning here until nearly eleven o'clock."</p>

<p>"The quartet probably kept it up pretty late."</p>

<p>"Then Mrs. John Newstrum, who lives directly
over this room, just told me that she heard persons
down here as late as ten o'clock, and after."</p>

<p>"Did she hear anything like a quarrel?"</p>

<p>"Nobody in the house heard any quarreling or
loud words during the night."</p>

<p>"Is it thought the murderers got away with much
wealth?"</p>

<p>"When we searched the house, a little while ago,
and talked with Mr. Zunder here, we concluded
that they probably got away with between four and
five hundred dollars. She was known to have about
that amount by her, as she was intending to pay
certain bills that were due."</p>

<p>"Not a very big haul, if that's all they got."</p>

<p>"I am confident they got no more than five hundred
dollars at the most," said Mr. Zunder, emphatically.</p>

<p>"I'll bet they had good reasons for believing that
they were going to get more," observed Detective
Reilly, confidently.</p>

<p>"There's no doubt about that," said the chief,
quickly; "they supposed the old woman kept her
pile right here in this basement."</p>

<p>"My theory," remarked Brewer, "is that the
murderer or murderers were very familiar with the
premises, and that they came here with the intention
of robbing the old woman of a big stake. In
order to carry out their villainous work, they first
bound and gagged her, and then got her onto the
sofa there."</p>

<p>"You don't think, then, Phil, that they intended
to murder her?" said Old Spicer, inquiringly.</p>

<p>"I do not," was the reply. "You see, after they
got that gag in her mouth, they probably began to
go through the several rooms, and left her tied
where she is now lying. The fact that she was such
a sufferer from asthma may not have been known
to the criminals. With a handkerchief stuck in her
mouth, and her asthmatic difficulty, you can readily
see that an old woman like her could not live
long."</p>

<p>"I believe you're right, Phil," said one of the
other detectives. "I don't believe they intended to
kill her."</p>

<p>"Have you questioned everybody in the house?"
asked Old Spicer of the chief.</p>

<p>"Yes," was the answer, "we have had something
to say to every one who lives here."</p>

<p>"You learned nothing more, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Nothing more of any consequence."</p>

<p>"Have you heard what this young man has to
say, chief?" asked Officer Cannon, indicating a
person of about twenty-five who was standing by
his side.</p>

<p>"No," answered the chief; "what is it?"</p>

<p>"Speak up for yourself, young man," said the
officer, encouragingly.</p>

<p>The young man, thus admonished, advanced and
said:</p>

<p>"I was returning from a whist party with a
friend about one o'clock this morning. Just before
we reached Spruce Street, on Oak, we heard
the loud talk of three men in a buggy. They acted
as if they might be partially intoxicated. The team
was going as rapidly as it could. Just before they
came up to where we were they spied us, and we
heard one of them say, 'hush!' Not a word more
came from their lips until long after they had
passed us, then we could hear them talking again."</p>

<p>"Hum! Did they come from this way?" asked
the chief.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; they were not far from this house when
we first saw them."</p>

<p>"Which way did they go after they had passed
you?"</p>

<p>"Toward Howe Street."</p>

<p>"Did you notice anything in the buggy?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; we both noticed it."</p>

<p>"What was it?"</p>

<p>"An ordinary packing box."</p>

<p>"In front?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; fastened in the rear, behind the seat."</p>

<p>"You are sure they didn't drive out Oak Street?"</p>

<p>"I am not quite sure; but I think they turned
into Howe."</p>

<p>"I have heard something of this story before,"
said the chief, aside to Old Spicer.</p>

<p>"It may be worth while looking those fellows
up," returned the old detective.</p>

<p>"I think so."</p>

<p>"What was it you had heard before?"</p>

<p>"Why, one of the women in the house here
peered from her front window down on the sidewalk,
somewhere about midnight, she thinks, and
saw three suspicious-looking characters talking in
subdued tones, near the steps leading to the saloon
below."</p>

<p>"Ah, I see; and joining our young friend's story
of the three men dashing toward Howe Street at
one o'clock, or through Oak Street, as <i>you</i> think,
with the woman's story of the whispering trio on
the sidewalk, you think there may be a clew that
will lead to important revelations?"</p>

<p>"It seems so to me&mdash;&mdash; Well, what is it, Woodford?"</p>

<p>"I've just found this handkerchief, sir," and Officer
Woodford handed a very fine embroidered handkerchief
to the chief.</p>

<p>"Where did you find it?" asked Bollmann, curiously,
as he carefully examined the delicate piece of
cambric.</p>

<p>"By the side of a chair in the next room. I
fancy it may have belonged to some one who was
with the murderer or murderers."</p>

<p>"'S. S.'" mused the chief, as he caught sight of
those initials in one corner of the handkerchief; "I'd
give something handsome to know what those two
letters stand for."</p>

<p>Old Spicer took the handkerchief from him, and
after a moment's inspection, said:</p>

<p>"Yes, this may prove a valuable clew. It may
be well to cultivate the acquaintance of S. S."</p>

<p>Chief Bollmann seized the cambric clew and hurried
away.</p>

<p>The old detective turned to Maier Zunder and abruptly
said:</p>

<p>"You have had charge of the dead woman's
financial affairs for a long time, I believe, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes," was the reply, "for a good many years.
In fact, I have looked after her money matters and
kept charge of her bank books of deposit ever since
she came to this city."</p>

<p>"You think she did not have a very large sum by
her last night?"</p>

<p>"I am pretty sure she did not."</p>

<p>"Not more than four or five hundred dollars, I
think you said?"</p>

<p>"Last Sunday she had one hundred and fifty dollars
by her. She wanted to paint her several
houses, and I let her have four hundred more."</p>

<p>"Had she paid the painters, do you think?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. If she had, she must still have
had some two or three hundred dollars left."</p>

<p>"Has any money been found here by the police?"</p>

<p>"Not a great deal, I believe."</p>

<p>"Only one dollar and seventy-five cents has been
found, either on her person or about the premises,"
said George Morgan.</p>

<p>"How much had she in the banks, Mr. Zunder?"</p>

<p>"Her bank books show credits to the amount of
$1500, and I have them safe in my care."</p>

<p>"Have you any idea who the criminals may be?"</p>

<p>"I think I could make a pretty close guess, Mr.
Spicer."</p>

<p>"I should like to know which way your suspicions
point."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, it is my decided opinion that Margaret
Ernst was murdered by parties in this house."</p>

<p>"Oh-ho! that's it, eh? Well, I think I see your
line of argument, sir, and I must say you reason
shrewdly."</p>

<p>"I am confident that when the truth is known
you will find I am right."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't at all wonder."</p>

<p>"At least," added the financial manager, "you
will find that some one in this house is seriously implicated,
mark that, Mr. Spicer."</p>

<p>"I will remember what you say." Then in another
tone:</p>

<p>"Let's see, how old was she?"</p>

<p>"Her age has been stated as seventy-two. I
think she was nearer seventy-four or seventy-five."</p>

<p>"She was from Germany?"</p>

<p>"Yes, from Oxburg, in Bavaria."</p>

<p>"She had made a will?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"To whom did she leave her property?"</p>

<p>"One half to her own relatives in the old country,
and the rest to the relatives of her last husband."</p>

<p>"He died about ten years ago?"</p>

<p>"Who, John Ernst?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Nearer twelve, I should say."</p>

<p>"He had been in this country some time?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he served in the Union army through the
late war."</p>

<p>"What was her maiden name?"</p>

<p>"Margaret Tepley."</p>

<p>"You heard what Bollmann's detectives said. Do
you think as they do, that there was no intention to
kill her?"</p>

<p>"Nonsense! She was deliberately murdered. The
back of her head was pounded against the arm of
that sofa, and afterward she was smothered with a
pillow. No intention to kill her? Pshaw! the poor
old lame woman attempted to make a fight of it.
Why, sir, she called out as loud as she could. Her
voice was heard distinctly by people in the house."</p>

<p>"So? You are quite sure of what you say?"</p>

<p>"Believe me. I know what I am talking about,
Mr. Spicer."</p>

<p>"I must see some of the people of the house."</p>

<p>"Do so. Go into the matter thoroughly."</p>

<p>"I generally do, Mr. Zunder."</p>

<p>"I know that; hence, I have faith in you. And
a word in your ear, Mr. Spicer. Your work shall
be well paid for. <i>I</i> will see to that. As you can
easily understand, I feel more than an ordinary
interest in this case."</p>

<p>"I understand. And you can depend on me, and
those associated with me, to do our level best to get
at the exact truth in this cold-blooded and cowardly
affair." And a moment later, after whispering to
Stricket and George Morgan, Old Spicer left the
basement.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<p class="center">OLD SPICER CONTINUES HIS INVESTIGATIONS.&mdash;THE
SECRET VAULT.</p>


<p>After a word or two with Coroner Mix, who was
standing in the outer hall, Old Spicer ascended to
the main floor of the house, where he questioned
Otto Webber and his wife, and then climbing another
flight of stairs, knocked at the door of John
Neustrom's apartments.</p>

<p>The door was opened by a young woman of perhaps
twenty summers, and the caller was invited to
enter.</p>

<p>There was another person in the room&mdash;a woman&mdash;who
was seated by the window.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Neustrom, if I am not mistaken?" said the
detective, in an inquiring tone, as his eyes rested on
this lady.</p>

<p>"Yes; I am Mrs. Neustrom," she said.</p>

<p>"And this is your charming niece, Miss Minnie?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the girl is my niece."</p>

<p>"I have called, Mrs. Neustrom, to put a few questions
to Miss Minnie with regard to what she saw
and heard last night at, I think, somewhere between
eleven and twelve o'clock;" and as he had not been
asked to sit down, Old Spicer now quietly seated
himself on his own accord.</p>

<p>"I am sorry, sir," said Mrs. Neustrom, in a tone
of decision; "but it will be impossible for her to answer
your questions."</p>

<p>"Why so?"</p>

<p>"She has been cautioned not to speak on the subject
to any one."</p>

<p>"By whom has she been cautioned?"</p>

<p>"By two, or more, of the officers of the law."</p>

<p>"Which ones?"</p>

<p>"Well, the chief, for one."</p>

<p>"And who else?"</p>

<p>"A detective."</p>

<p>"I suppose you know something of the law governing
such cases, Mrs. Neustrom?"</p>

<p>"I know very little about the matter, sir."</p>

<p>"I am sorry to hear that."</p>

<p>"If Mr. Neustrom were home, he might know.
He's pretty well posted."</p>

<p>"Then he's not in the house at present?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; he went out a little while ago with one
of the detectives."</p>

<p>"That's very unfortunate. But as it happens, I
also am pretty well posted in the law."</p>

<p>"You are?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am, and I assure you, in such cases, the
law places unlimited authority in the hands of the
coroner."</p>

<p>"It does?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am, and he has ordered me to get Miss
Minnie's testimony. I have also the authority of
the late Mrs. Ernst's executor to back me. In short,
I am employed by these two gentlemen."</p>

<p>"And who may you be, sir?"</p>

<p>"My name is Spicer&mdash;Mark Spicer," answered the
detective with a polite bow. "It's just possible you
may have heard of me before."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Minnie Neustrom, eagerly.
"Old Spicer! Of course, auntie, I shall tell him
everything."</p>

<p>"Why, certainly, my dear," answered her aunt,
"especially as it's the law."</p>

<p>Old Spicer smiled quietly, and turning to the young
lady, said:</p>

<p>"You saw three strange men hovering round the
premises until nearly midnight, I believe?"</p>

<p>"Two, not three, sir," answered Minnie.</p>

<p>"Only two? I understood you said three."</p>

<p>"No, sir; there were only two."</p>

<p>"What first attracted your attention to them,
Miss Neustrom?"</p>

<p>"Their loud talking, sir."</p>

<p>"Loud talking, eh? Where were they when you
first heard them?"</p>

<p>"In Mrs. Ernst's kitchen, I think."</p>

<p>"How did it happen that you were up so late last
night?"</p>

<p>"I had been down-town, and did not reach home
until after half-past ten o'clock."</p>

<p>"And you did not go to bed at once when you
did reach home?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. Before I retired, auntie, here, asked
me to lock the woodshed door."</p>

<p>"Where is your woodshed?"</p>

<p>"In the yard, in the rear of the house; and in
order to reach it I was obliged to go down two
flights of stairs. You may think it strange, sir, but
even while I was obeying the instructions of my aunt
a horrible dread that something awful was soon to
occur came over me, and my trip to the woodshed
was made literally in fear and trembling."</p>

<p>"Then, I take it, you were not long in accomplishing
your purpose?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed, it took but a second to bolt the
woodshed door, and an additional minute or two
for me to retrace my steps."</p>

<p>"And then you went to your window?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; for, you see, from the window of my
room, a person can look down on the rear apartment
windows of the basement. I raised the window,
but could not hear the words used in the basement
below, although the parties there seemed to
be still quarreling with their tongues."</p>

<p>"Were they Germans?" asked Old Spicer.</p>

<p>"No, sir; I am quite positive they were not."</p>

<p>"What makes you so sure about it?"</p>

<p>"Because the indistinct utterances I overheard
did not sound at all like those coming from a Teutonic
tongue."</p>

<p>"You caught sight of these parties at last, did
you not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; just before I went to bed I saw from
my window the forms of two men issuing from the
basement and prowling in the yard."</p>

<p>"Would you know those men again?"</p>

<p>"Good gracious! no, sir."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"A heavy fog had settled in the neighborhood,
making it impossible for me to obtain a clear view
of them, or, indeed, of any objects forty feet
away."</p>

<p>"When you found you couldn't make out who
they were, what did you do?"</p>

<p>"I went to bed."</p>

<p>"A very wise proceeding, I must confess." Then
abruptly:</p>

<p>"Miss Neustrom, I would like to see you alone for
a few minutes."</p>

<p>The girl started and looked at her aunt.</p>

<p>That good woman seemed bewildered, and didn't
know what to say.</p>

<p>"I shall not detain you for more than a few minutes,"
said the detective in a reassuring tone. "This
room will do," and he pointed to what might have
been the dining-room.</p>

<p>"Come, then," said Minnie, and, opening the
door, she led the way into the next apartment.</p>

<p>They remained together for more than a quarter
of an hour, and then Old Spicer took his leave.</p>

<p>Where he spent the rest of the day is not positively
known; but that night, at nine o'clock, he
sat in his own back parlor, calmly waiting the
coming of Seth Stricket and George Morgan.</p>

<p>At length, within a few minutes of each other,
they both arrived, and as soon as they were seated,
Old Spicer impatiently asked:</p>

<p>"Well, what have you to tell me? I suppose you
have found out something of importance?"</p>

<p>"Who shall speak first?" asked George, with a
smile.</p>

<p>"Let's hear from you," said the old detective.</p>

<p>"Very well," was the reply. "The first thing of
importance I have to mention is the traces of footprints
I found in the yard just north of the Ernst
homestead."</p>

<p>"Ah! footprints, eh? Were they plain&mdash;distinct?"</p>

<p>"Some of them were quite so. You see, the
parties, whoever they were, that went through this
yard, walked over ground that has been recently
planted with vegetables, and the tracks of their
boots or shoes are still discernible."</p>

<p>"But have you any good reason for supposing
these tracks were made by the parties we are looking
for?"</p>

<p>"It is quite evident, from the direction they take,
that those who made them came from the Ernst
back yard, and proceeded to the fence on the north
boundary-line of the property next beyond. There
are also what I regard as unmistakable signs on the
high board fence where some one tried to climb
that fence very recently."</p>

<p>"You measured the footprints?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Could you get casts of them?"</p>

<p>"I managed to get two or three, but none that
are quite perfect."</p>

<p>"That's all well enough, George," said Old Spicer,
after a moment's reflection; "and yet what I can't
quite understand is why the murderers should have
taken the trouble to climb that fence and go across
that yard, when it would have been much more convenient
for them to have walked right out the front
door of the barroom, for no one, so far as I can
learn, was on the street at that hour. Then, too,
such a course would have taken them clear of high
fences, back yards, and a possible watch-dog."</p>

<p>"I can't explain the matter," smiled George;
"but there are the marks on the fence, and there
are the footprints."</p>

<p>"Well, they shall have due consideration, of
course. And now what next?"</p>

<p>"The next piece of information I have to offer is&mdash;there's
a woman in the case!"</p>

<p>"So? Well, there generally is. What evidence
have you got on this point?"</p>

<p>"You know how many handkerchiefs were used
in binding the poor old woman's limbs and in gagging
her?"</p>

<p>"Yes, five, at least, I should say."</p>

<p>"And then, you remember, Woodford found another?"</p>

<p>"Yes, marked 'S. S.'"</p>

<p>"And now I have found still another, which is
certainly the property of a woman."</p>

<p>"Is there any mark upon it?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I have found the initials 'E. B.,' or 'C.
B.,' in one corner, and there yet lingers in it the
scent of a cheap perfume."</p>

<p>"Let me see the handkerchief."</p>

<p>Morgan took it from his pocket and handed it to
Old Spicer.</p>

<p>He carefully examined the two letters in the corner.</p>

<p>"It's hard to say whether they are 'E. B.' or 'C.
B.,'" he said at last; "but I am inclined to think
the latter."</p>

<p>Then he put the handkerchief to his nose.</p>

<p>"Hum. Cheap perfume, eh?" he said.</p>

<p>"Yes; can't you detect it?" asked George.</p>

<p>"I certainly detect an odor&mdash;a peculiar odor; but
<i>I</i> don't call it perfume."</p>

<p>"What do you call it, then?"</p>

<p>"If I were to give it a name, I should call it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, what?"</p>

<p>"Chloroform."</p>

<p>"Chloroform!"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"By Jove! I believe you're right."</p>

<p>"I know I am right. Where did you find this
handkerchief?"</p>

<p>"Just behind the head of the sofa, where it had
fallen; and why some one hadn't found it before is
more than I can understand."</p>

<p>"I suppose because they didn't like to disturb the
resting-place of the body."</p>

<p>"That must be it; for I had to move the sofa out
a little to get at it."</p>

<p>"And you think, from the fact of having found
this handkerchief, that there was a woman with the
murderers?"</p>

<p>"I think there may have been. The male portion
of humanity, as a general thing, do not go to
the extremity of initialing their pocket-handkerchiefs,
and few men carry a piece of cambric so
fine as this. Then, too, ordinarily, a man is not
armed with more than one handkerchief at a time&mdash;especially
those of the class of citizens that made
the Ernst saloon their headquarters. So, speculating
on such a basis and also on the fact that all of
the seven handkerchiefs might reasonably be called
those of females, I think there is little doubt but one
woman at least, assisted materially in this murderous
work."</p>

<p>"I am inclined to agree with you, George. By
the way, did you manage to learn anything more
about that trap-door and secret tunnel?"</p>

<p>"Very little. As you didn't want me to explore
it when any of the regular force were about, I was
obliged to confine myself to questioning such of the
widow's patrons and neighbors as I thought might
have some information on the subject to impart."</p>

<p>"Well, you found out something from them?"</p>

<p>"Yes, one fellow had a somewhat romantic story
to tell. Years ago, he said, when the Sunday liquor-law
was so strictly enforced in this city, Mrs. Ernst
and her second husband, who was then living, built
an immense underground vault in the back-yard, at
some distance from the house, and that trap-door
opens into a tunnel leading to this vault, which, by
the way, is capable of accommodating quite a number
of persons.</p>

<p>"The thing was a grand success. There were, of
course, strong suspicions that the woman and her
last two husbands were violating the law by selling
liquor and beer on Sunday, but no evidence of a
positive character could be obtained, and the reason
was that this great underground chamber was so
secluded and so vigilantly guarded that the entrance
to it was known to only the best and most reliable
customers.</p>

<p>"The thirsty, on a Sunday afternoon or evening,
were seen to enter the basement, but all traces of
them thereafter for hours were lost. A close watch,
and even a personal inspection of the premises,
were unavailing, inasmuch as the patrons could not
be seen anywhere. They were secreted in the underground
vault, indulging in all the liquid nourishment
they wanted, while the searchers were vainly
peering into this room and that of the basement.
A cart-load of ashes, you remember, now partially
fills up the entrance to the vault."</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember the ashes, and I have no doubt
there is exactly such a vault as your informant describes,
and that it was used for the purpose he
names; but I am inclined to believe it has been used
for other purposes since. Of that, however, hereafter.
What more have you to tell me, George?"</p>

<p>"I understand that quite a number of the tenants
over there are going to move within the next few
days."</p>

<p>"Is that so? Did you learn which ones?"</p>

<p>"No; but the Neustrom family are among them."</p>

<p>"Ah, indeed! Well, on the whole, I am not surprised
to hear it," and the old detective became
very thoughtful.</p>

<p class="center">SETH STRICKET MAKES HIS REPORT.</p>


<p>At length, rousing himself, Old Spicer turned to
Stricket, and said:</p>

<p>"Well, Seth, I suppose you have something interesting
to tell us?"</p>

<p>"I have managed to pick up a little information,"
was the modest reply.</p>

<p>"Very good; let's have it."</p>

<p>"George has been talking about the seven handkerchiefs.
He has told you that some, if not all of
them, belong to women. I can tell you what
woman one of them, at least, belongs to."</p>

<p>"The deuce you can! Who is she?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Otto Webber."</p>

<p>"What! the wife of the cigar-maker who lives
directly over the barroom?"</p>

<p>"The same."</p>

<p>"You are sure you are right?"</p>

<p>"I have positively identified one of the handkerchiefs
as belonging to her. And more than that, I
have discovered parties who are ready to swear that
they have seen the cloth found about Mrs. Ernst's
head in the possession of the Webbers within the
past forty-eight hours."</p>

<p>"You are getting on fast, Seth."</p>

<p>"I am not through yet."</p>

<p>"Well, what next?"</p>

<p>"Stairs, you know, lead directly from the apartments
occupied by Mrs. Ernst to those occupied by
the Webbers."</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember."</p>

<p>"Well, Monday night Mr. Webber called on the
murdered woman and informed her that he was
going to leave her house, but had found another
tenant for her."</p>

<p>"I know he did."</p>

<p>"He admits now that he stayed in the saloon for
some time, and drank liquor with the old lady; but
he claims that she was in the best of spirits when he
left her, which, he says, was before ten o'clock."</p>

<p>"Does Bollmann, or any of the regular force suspect
Webber?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Have they let him find it out?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Thunder! how far have they gone in the matter?"</p>

<p>"Both Webber and his wife were brought to the
police office by Detective Brewer early this evening."</p>

<p>"Do you know what followed?"</p>

<p>"Chief Bollmann, Coroner Mix, and the detectives
questioned Webber for over an hour, and then
subjected Mrs. Weber to a similar examination."</p>

<p>"Hum! What did it all amount to?"</p>

<p>"Not much. One of the officials informed me
that when Webber was brought to the police office
the expectation was that he would not be allowed to
depart again until a jury had pronounced him
guilty or not guilty of the crime of murder; but
after the rigid examination was over, the coroner
decided that it would not be best to place him
under arrest at present."</p>

<p>"Webber was allowed to go home, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but policemen were detailed to watch his
house all night."</p>

<p>"Do the authorities know all that you know?"</p>

<p>"No. I thought it wasn't best to give anything
away just yet."</p>

<p>"Right; but I hope you also established a watch
on his movements?"</p>

<p>"You may be sure I have the right man looking
after him. And he isn't the only one I am having
shadowed either."</p>

<p>"Is that so? Who is the other party?"</p>

<p>"August Strouse, a German Anarchist, who,
until last week lived in the house occupied by the
murdered woman."</p>

<p>"And you have good reasons for suspecting this
fellow, you think?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I think so. You see, Strouse did not pay
the rent of the rooms he occupied, and was told to
move by Mrs. Ernst. He moved, but swore he
would make trouble for the old woman before he
was many weeks older."</p>

<p>"Is he a single man?"</p>

<p>"No, he has a wife and two children, but is considered
a pretty tough character."</p>

<p>"Has he a police record?"</p>

<p>"Yes; a few months ago he was arrested for
theft and was found guilty. I have no doubt that
a more careful search would show that he has been
up for other crimes."</p>

<p>"What put you on his track?"</p>

<p>"I came across a reliable party who, after giving
me other valuable information, told me that he saw
Strouse enter Mrs. Ernst's apartments shortly before
nine o'clock last night. He further said that
Strouse entered the basement by way of one of the
rear doors&mdash;sneaked in, as it were&mdash;and probably hid
himself in the old woman's bedroom."</p>

<p>"Have you seen this fellow yourself?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I started out after him, and after a long
search, found him in Fred Siebold's saloon on State
Street."</p>

<p>"How did he act?"</p>

<p>"He seemed to have plenty of money and was
slightly under the influence of liquor."</p>

<p>"Did you speak with him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I questioned him a little, in a careless sort
of way."</p>

<p>"What did he have to say for himself?"</p>

<p>"He denied that he was in Mrs. Ernst's place
last night, and said he had not been there since last
week when he moved."</p>

<p>"He said that, did he?"</p>

<p>"He did."</p>

<p>"And the man who claims to have seen him enter
one of her back doors is perfectly reliable, is he?"</p>

<p>"He is; I'll vouch for him myself."</p>

<p>"It looks bad for Mr. Strouse then, it seems to
me."</p>

<p>"That's the way I look at it. Indeed, I am confident
that he knows something about the murder."</p>

<p>"You are having him shadowed, you say?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Ned Nugent, properly disguised, is on his
track."</p>

<p>"Don't let him lose sight of him. This worthy
anarchist may lead us to something."</p>

<p>"I've no doubt he will; and he may lead us to a
point that will surprise you."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?"</p>

<p>"Simply this: Not long ago Mrs. Ernst was visited
by her brother, August Tepley, of Oxburg, Bavaria.
Of course he was hard up and looking out for
number one, otherwise he wouldn't have come.
By keeping at her, he at last succeeded in inducing
his sister to loan him three hundred dollars, and he
obtained a good knowledge of her financial affairs.</p>

<p>"It was commonly reported that Mrs. Ernst was
worth at least $50,000, and that most of her money
was kept hidden about her apartments. Her brother
believed this. He knew exactly how she had left
her property, and he tried to induce her to change
her will in his favor. She did not do so, though I
think in time she might.</p>

<p>"But the man was greedy and anxious. As I
have just said, he believed the greater part of that
$50,000 was in the house. August Strouse was also
in the house. Naturally these two met."</p>

<p>"It is <i>said</i> that August Tepley went back to
Bavaria, but I have had it hinted to me that he was
seen only a few days ago in New York, and, indeed,
even nearer than that.</p>

<p>"The other August, the anarchist, went down the
road a few evenings since. You can put this and
that together as well as I can."</p>

<p>Stricket ceased to speak, and there was profound
silence in the little back parlor for some minutes.</p>

<p>At length George Morgan exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Thunder! gentlemen, this case begins to wear a
mighty ugly look."</p>

<p>"There does appear to be something pretty black
about it," mused Old Spicer, "yes, there does, for a
fact." Then abruptly:</p>

<p>"What are you going to do for the next hour or
so, Seth?"</p>

<p>"Get a little rest, if the thing is possible."</p>

<p>"By all means, my dear fellow. And you,
George?"</p>

<p>"Can I be of any service to you, sir?" asked
George, quickly.</p>

<p>"It is quite possible you can."</p>

<p>"Then I am going with you."</p>

<p>"All right. Seth, you lie down on this lounge.
George and I will be gone about two hours. After
that we will see what it is best to do."</p>

<p>"Very well, sir," and throwing himself upon the
lounge, in less than a minute Seth Stricket was
fast asleep.</p>

<p>A moment later Old Spicer and George Morgan
left the house, and hurried out of Home Place.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

<p class="center">HORRIFIED WATCHERS&mdash;IN THE TUNNELS AND VAULT.</p>


<p>"Where are we going, sir, if it's a fair question?"
asked George, as they hastened up Court
Street.</p>

<p>"To the Ernst House," was the brief reply.</p>

<p>"You expect to find out something there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I expect to find out something about
August Strouse, and I expect to learn something
about that tunnel and vault from personal observation."</p>

<p>"Ah! you are going into it to-night, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"But Bollmann's men are in the house."</p>

<p>"We must manage to hoodwink them."</p>

<p>"I don't see how it can be done."</p>

<p>"Nor do I; but we shall find a way."</p>

<p>At length they arrived in York Street.</p>

<p>"Now, then," said Old Spicer, "you have been
over this ground."</p>

<p>"Yes," was the answer, "I think I know it pretty
well."</p>

<p>"Then conduct me through the passage into the
backyard of the Ernst House."</p>

<p>"This way, sir," and George led him through a
narrow passage at the end of the brick block.</p>

<p>Presently they found themselves in the yard back
of the basement saloon.</p>

<p>Old Spicer tried one of the basement doors.</p>

<p>It was locked.</p>

<p>He tried the next.</p>

<p>It yielded, and he entered, closely followed by
George.</p>

<p>He led the way toward the room in which the
trap door was situated. But in passing the bar-room,
he saw, through the open door, three men
grouped together in chairs, while a coffin, containing
all that was mortal of Margaret Ernst, occupied
the center of the apartment.</p>

<p>The darkness of the place was only dissipated in a
small degree by an oil lamp, which burned dimly on
the bar.</p>

<p>"Who are they?" asked Old Spicer, with his lips
close to Morgan's ear.</p>

<p>"One's Cohen," was the answer; "another is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Webber, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"By Jove! I believe it is."</p>

<p>"And who is the third?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; I can't see his face."</p>

<p>"Well, hark, then; let's hear what they have to
say."</p>

<p>"Yes," the unknown was saying at this point,
"it was the worst experience I ever had. I never
want to be frightened so badly as that again."</p>

<p>"Tell us all about it, old fellow," urged Cohen.</p>

<p>"Well, you see, we had got the body in the way
I hinted a moment ago; and in order not to attract
too much attention, we laid it over on the back
seat of the carriage, and my friend Jim and I took
the front seat and drove off.</p>

<p>"By and by we came to a lonely road, leading
through a piece of woods. As we entered the
woods I thought I heard a slight sound just back of
me, as of some one moving.</p>

<p>"Jim heard it too, and we looked back simultaneously.</p>

<p>"One glance was enough; then we gave a yell of
horror and sprung from the carriage, Jim on his
side and I on mine; and the way we legged it for
the open country was a caution."</p>

<p>"Why," exclaimed Webber, "what the deuce
was it that frightened you so?"</p>

<p>"Yes," added Cohen, "what did you see when
you looked back?"</p>

<p>"See? We saw that confounded corpse sitting
bolt upright on the rear seat, like any live man.
And at the very moment our eyes rested upon him,
he started forward, placing one hand on the front
seat by my side, and the other on Jim's back, while
his great wide-open eyes stared fixedly into mine."</p>

<p>"Good Lord! I should have thought you would
have been frightened," exclaimed Webber.</p>

<p>"How did it all turn out?" asked Cohen.</p>

<p>"Why, this way," was the reply. "After running
some distance, we stopped to consult. While
we stood there, a man with a heavily-loaded wagon
drove up and asked us what we were doing on such
a lonely road at that time of night.</p>

<p>"I told him we were taking a dead body to the city
for Dr. White, and that it had suddenly started up
and driven us from our carriage.</p>

<p>"He said he couldn't swallow that story. We
swore it was true. Then he asked where we had left
the carriage. We told him about half a mile ahead.
'Come on and show me, then,' he said. 'I have a
rifle and two revolvers here; I guess with those we
are enough for one dead man, at least;' so we went
forward with him.</p>

<p>"At length we came to our carriage; the horse
had merely gone to one side of the road, and was
quietly cropping the grass.</p>

<p>"The man took a lantern from his wagon, lighted
it, and approached the carriage. Then we heard
him laugh.</p>

<p>"'Come here,' he cried, 'and see what started
your corpse to life.'</p>

<p>"We hastened forward, and saw at once that the
dead man had not altered his position since we had
so abruptly left him.</p>

<p>"Our new friend then pointed out to us how
the wind had carried the ends of the loose robe
in which the corpse was dressed on to the wheels.
The motion of the wheels had then pulled the robe
so that the corpse which it enveloped was raised to
a sitting position, and at last drawn forward in the
way I have described."</p>

<p>"And so&mdash;and so," murmured Webber, in a voice
trembling with emotion, "and so you don't believe
the fellow had come to life at all?"</p>

<p>"Of course not."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't know. I've often thought&mdash;&mdash; Good
Lord! what's that?"</p>

<p>The three men were seated near the foot of the
casket, Webber having his back turned to it.</p>

<p>At the head of the casket was a window, and this
was raised to permit the circulation of fresh air in
the interior of the basement.</p>

<p>A lemon-colored curtain was dropped over the
window to regulate the force of the wind that came
through the aperture.</p>

<p>A sudden and powerful gust came through, and
the curtain rustled against the window, making a
noise as if somebody's dress was rubbing against
the side of a wall. The sound had landed on the
sensitive ears of Mr. Webber as if it had come from
the coffin.</p>

<p>There was not a soul in the room at the time but
the three individuals, and they had been whispering
in low tones. It is no wonder, then, that Mr.
Webber promptly concluded, from the direction of
the noise, that it came from the interior of the coffin,
or that the pale glamour which one sees on the
faces of painted women under an electric light
quickly drove the flush of health from his face.</p>

<p>Then he suddenly turned, half in despair at the
thought of seeing some movement in the casket.</p>

<p>He noticed nothing unusual, but for a minute he
kept his eyes fastened on the face of the murdered
woman, and his imagination, wrought upon by the
story he had just heard, led him to believe that her
eyes were fixed upon him with a steady and stern
expression.</p>

<p>He grasped the arms of the chair, and half-way
started up.</p>

<p>At that moment a deep, hollow groan, which was
distinctly heard by all, came apparently from the
lips of the corpse.</p>

<p>Webber gave a yell of horror, and dashing out of
the bar-room, flew up the area steps into the
street.</p>

<p>The other two, after one startled glance at the
corpse, darted after their fleeing companion, and
never even so much as stopped to breathe until they
were far down George Street.</p>

<p>"Now, George," said Old Spicer, quietly, "I think
we shall be able to get into the tunnel and vault
without being seen."</p>

<p>"No doubt," responded young Morgan; "but
how about getting out again? In ten minutes those
fools will have a crowd here to see the murdered
woman's ghost."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't at all wonder, my boy. But never
mind the getting out. If necessary, you know, we
can wait in there till the crowd is gone."</p>

<p>"Yes, and all that time Stricket will be waiting
for us."</p>

<p>"I fancy he'll sleep till we get back, even if it
isn't till morning."</p>

<p>"All right, then, I'm ready to dive into the bowels
of the earth."</p>

<p>"I'm glad to hear it. Come on. But, by Jove!
I've forgotten my dark-lantern. What shall we
do?"</p>

<p>"There's that light on the bar there."</p>

<p>"That'll do, bring it along."</p>

<p>"But what'll they say when they come back and
find it gone?"</p>

<p>"No matter what they say. Most likely they'll
think Mrs. Ernst's ghost has hidden it."</p>

<p>"By Jove! I shouldn't at all wonder," and, with
a laugh, George entered the barroom, and securing
the oil lamp, returned to the so-called reception-room.</p>

<p>Old Spicer now raised the trap-door.</p>

<p>With some little difficulty he climbed over the
ash-heap, and taking the lamp from George, waited
until he had closed the trap and joined him.</p>

<p>Then together they moved forward through the
tunnel, which they found much wider and higher
than the opening had given them any reason to expect.</p>

<p>At length, after walking some distance, they
came to a door that closed up the end of the tunnel.</p>

<p>"Great Jove!" exclaimed Morgan, "suppose it
should be locked!"</p>

<p>"I don't think it is," replied Old Spicer quietly,
and taking hold of the knob he pulled it open.</p>

<p>The door was of iron and quite heavy, but it
moved on its hinges with the utmost ease.</p>

<p>"Oh, ho!" said Old Spicer, "those hinges have
been oiled, and that quite recently."</p>

<p>He then examined them, and found he was right.</p>

<p>The key&mdash;a large one&mdash;was found in the lock.</p>

<p>The two detectives now entered the vault, which
they found, as Morgan had already been informed,
was a very large one.</p>

<p>It was plainly to be seen that the place had once
been fitted up for a barroom; but it was also quite
evident that it had more recently been used as a
secret rendezvous, and to some extent as a sleeping-room;
indeed, there were sleeping accommodations
for at least half a dozen men.</p>

<p>Old Spicer looked about him with a thoughtful expression
of countenance.</p>

<p>"What are you thinking of?" suddenly asked
Morgan.</p>

<p>"This place is deep down under ground," answered
Old Spicer, "and yet men have assembled
here and slept here. That they could not do without
plenty of fresh air. Now the question is, how
is the place ventilated?"</p>

<p>Morgan hesitated a moment, then he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Why, by means of the tunnel, of course."</p>

<p>"What tunnel?"</p>

<p>"The one through which we reached this vault."</p>

<p>"Wrong, George; the trap-door closes tightly,
and the tunnel has no aperture in all its length."</p>

<p>"Then I give it up."</p>

<p>"That won't do, my boy, we must find the opening."</p>

<p>"All right, sir," and George immediately began
the search in earnest.</p>

<p>But Old Spicer had already started with the same
end in view, and rightly judging that the most
likely place would be about opposite the door
through which they had entered, he began his examination
there, and almost immediately found
what he was in search of.</p>

<p>It proved to be an opening about a foot square,
close to the ground, and was concealed by a fixed
table.</p>

<p>On searching further, Old Spicer found, just in
front of this aperture, a trap-door, which opened
under the table, and could be fastened to it.</p>

<p>On lifting the trap a flight of five steps was revealed.
These the two detectives descended, and
immediately found themselves in another tunnel,
leading toward York Street.</p>

<p>This they followed, and presently came to another
door, which, with some difficulty, they opened, and
found themselves in the sub-cellar of a spacious
house.</p>

<p>"Ah, ha!" exclaimed Old Spicer, in a tone of
great satisfaction, "I thought it would turn out
something like this. Now let us make certain of the
way out, and then return and examine the big vault
more at our leisure."</p>

<p>"What's this?" asked Morgan, pointing to a small
sheet-iron door.</p>

<p>"That must open into a coal vault, I should
think," returned Spicer; "but let's see," and he
opened the door.</p>

<p>A glance showed that the place had in fact been
built for a coal vault, but it was quite evident it
had not been used as such for a long time. It contained
only a very high step-ladder, which was
standing directly under the coal-hole, which was
closed with an iron cover and fastened on the under
side.</p>

<p>"That's our way out," said Old Spicer, pointing
to the hole.</p>

<p>"But where will we find ourselves when we get
out?" asked George.</p>

<p>"In the narrow passageway you led me through
less than an hour ago, if I am not greatly mistaken,"
was the answer.</p>

<p>"I believe you're right, by Jove!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think I am."</p>

<p>"Then that matter is settled."</p>

<p>"Yes. But hold up a moment, George."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>

<p class="center">TWO IMPORTANT AND INTERESTING CHARACTERS.</p>


<p>"What's the matter?" asked George Morgan,
wonderingly.</p>

<p>"It strikes me," replied Old Spicer, "that there
must be some other means of entrance and exit to
this sub-cellar known to and controlled by the frequenters
of the great vault."</p>

<p>"What makes you think so?"</p>

<p>"Look up there. What do you see?"</p>

<p>"Why, the coal-hole and its iron cover."</p>

<p>"Is the cover fastened over the hole?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"If any one has gone out by that way lately
could they have fastened down the cover after them
as we see it now?"</p>

<p>"Of course not."</p>

<p>"If any one expects to visit the great vault to-night,
for instance, could they do so by way of this
coal-hole?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not."</p>

<p>"Then isn't it evident that there must be some
other way to reach the sub-cellar known to the frequenters
of the vault?"</p>

<p>"It would seem so. And yet, if no one has visited
the place since the murder the thing is easily explained."</p>

<p>"How do you explain it?"</p>

<p>"Why, the murderers possibly entered through
this coal-hole, and fastened the cover after them.
If so, they went on to Margaret Ernst's basement,
through the vault and the other tunnel. They
killed the old woman, and, as a blind, filled up the
entrance to the tunnel with ashes, which they found
close by, and then escaped, probably through her
back-yard."</p>

<p>"That's all very well so far as it goes, George;
but, unfortunately for your theory, some one has
visited that vault since the murder, and they have
neither entered nor departed through Mrs. Ernst's
basement."</p>

<p>"Thunder! how do you know that?"</p>

<p>"By means of a piece of to-day's newspaper,
which I picked up in the vault."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, you've got me this time, sure."</p>

<p>"You admit, then, that there must be another
entrance from this side?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"Let us find it, then."</p>

<p>"I'm with you, sir," and the search began.</p>

<p>It lasted close on to half an hour, when Old
Spicer suddenly uttered a low exclamation of satisfaction,
and Morgan at once knew he had found
what he was looking for.</p>

<p>He at once joined the old detective, who silently
pointed to a dark opening in the front foundation
wall, below the level of the cellar bottom, and
partially concealed by some empty barrels.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked George, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Don't you understand?"</p>

<p>"By Jove, I do not."</p>

<p>"Well," said Old Spicer, "I can see it all as
plain as day. That opening leads into an abandoned
sewer, which is connected with a catch-basin at the
next corner, where, undoubtedly, there is a ladder,
or iron spikes are driven into the walls, by means
of which those making use of this peculiar passage,
enter the cellar, or reach the street."</p>

<p>"By thunder! this is a shrewder thing than the
other."</p>

<p>"That's a fact; but unless we are driven to it, I
prefer to use the other exit."</p>

<p>"So do I."</p>

<p>"Well, now that we know exactly how the land
lies, let us return to the vault."</p>

<p>"All right, sir," and they hastened back.</p>

<p>On crawling out from under the table that concealed
the trap, they began a regular and systematic
search of the place. Not a bunk, not a drawer, not
a box, not a corner was neglected, and before the
search was well over, Old Spicer was abundantly
satisfied with his success.</p>

<p>He had found several bits of evidence that were
likely to prove important in more than one great
criminal case; and behind a tier of bunks he found
a door leading into a smaller vault, originally intended,
no doubt, for the storage of liquors, but
which for some time had been abandoned, and possibly
forgotten.</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed Old Spicer, as he surveyed the
smaller vault, "this may prove useful, George, before
very long."</p>

<p>"I don't see how," replied the younger detective,
in a tone of surprise.</p>

<p>"If I am not very much mistaken, you will see,
and that very soon. Hark!"</p>

<p>Morgan listened and distinctly heard the sound of
footsteps in the tunnel leading from York Street.</p>

<p>"Go in there," whispered Old Spicer, pointing toward
the smaller vault.</p>

<p>Then, hastily closing the trap-door under the
table, he squeezed his way behind the tier of bunks,
moved them back to their place, and joined George
in the inner vault, leaving the door slightly ajar,
and so was prepared to both see and listen.</p>

<p>Hardly were his preparations completed, when
the trap-door under the table was raised up and a
man, of no very prepossessing appearance, showed
his head.</p>

<p>No sooner had he crawled out from under the
table than another and younger man appeared.</p>

<p>"Shust help me out, Parney," said this last.
"I've got my goat caught mit this hook here."</p>

<p>Barney unhooked his companion's coat and helped
him to his feet.</p>

<p>"You thundering fool," he growled, "why will
you persist in wearing that great, heavy, conspicuous-looking
coat at all times and seasons of the year?
It will get you into some cursed trouble yet."</p>

<p>"Ah, my tear Parney, dot vos a goot goats&mdash;it vos
a perfect goats; shust think uf all der bockets, und
vot er lot uf shwag I vos able ter garry avay mit
'em."</p>

<p>"Well, well, I see you're stuck on the blamed
coat, and so I'll say no more about the outlandish-looking
thing just now. But come, sit down there,
and let's get to business."</p>

<p>"Vate a minute, Parney. Let's make sure der
bolice hain't struck der blace since ve vos here," and
the young Hebrew picked up the dark-lantern Barney
had placed on the table, and disappeared in the
tunnel, in the direction of the Ernst basement.</p>

<p>He was gone some minutes. When he returned
he exclaimed, somewhat excitedly:</p>

<p>"So 'elp me gracious, Parney, dere vos somepody
peen in der tunnels since ve vos 'ere pefore!"</p>

<p>"How do you know that, Jake?"</p>

<p>"Dot ashes; you remember?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Vell, it vos kicked apout like anything."</p>

<p>"Hum! then they've found the trap-door for certain;
but they may not have come very far into the
tunnel."</p>

<p>"Dey vos comed a leetle vays anyhow; I see der
tracks."</p>

<p>"The deuce you say! Then they may come further
next time."</p>

<p>"Dot's vot I vos dinking, Parney."</p>

<p>"Well, it isn't at all likely they'll come to-night,
so let's get ahead with our business and then dig
out."</p>

<p>"All right. You got somedings to trink, Parney?
I don't feel shust right."</p>

<p>"Confound you, Jake Klinghammer, you are always
sponging on somebody&mdash;if you can. Where's
that flask of whisky I saw you take from behind
McCarthy's bar to-night?"</p>

<p>"I didn't dake no vhisky at McCarthy's, Parney.
I didn't, so 'elp me gracious."</p>

<p>"Well, you took something. What was it?"</p>

<p>"Oh! I remember now, Parney. It vos shust a
leetle drop uv prandy&mdash;nodding more. I bledge you
my word."</p>

<p>"By heavens, Jake, you're a pretty fellow."</p>

<p>"Dot vos vot my girl dinks."</p>

<p>"She's an excellent judge, no doubt."</p>

<p>"You shust pet she vos, Parney."</p>

<p>"Well, pass the brandy, and let me see if it is fit
for a gentleman to drink. If it is, I may be induced
to take some."</p>

<p>"All right, I give you a daste," said Jake, handing
him the flask. "I vosn't so mean as you, Parney."</p>

<p>"Oh! you ain't, eh? Well, that's all right. Here's
good luck to your <i>liberal</i> soul," and placing the
flask to his lips, he poured about half its contents
down his throat.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he exclaimed, as he set down the flask,
"that's pretty good; must be some of McCarthy's
best. Better get some more of it when you're there
again. Don't forget, Jake."</p>

<p>"So 'elp me gracious, Parney, dot vos an awful
cheek you've got."</p>

<p>"Think so?"</p>

<p>"Think so!" echoed Jake, as he put up the half-emptied
flask. "Holy Moses! if I have dot cheek, I
vos rich. I vould always have blenty ov 'prass'
apout me, you see&mdash;ha! ha!"</p>

<p>"Well, I admit it has been of some service to me,
and I fancy it will assist me through the remainder
of my life&mdash;to a considerable extent."</p>

<p>"Dere vos no doubt of dot, you pet."</p>

<p>"Not much, I guess. But then, you know, Jake,
I need a little cheek to travel with you!"</p>

<p>"By Father Abraham!" muttered Jake, meaningly,
"I pet you need somedings after this, my poy,
so it vas pest you look out."</p>

<p>"What are you growling about now?" demanded
Barney, sharply.</p>

<p>"Noddings, Parney&mdash;shust noddings at all. Now
vot you got to told me apout dot leetle schob down
pelow?"</p>

<p>"A good deal, so prepare yourself to listen."</p>

<p>"Vill it dake a goot vhile, Parney?"</p>

<p>"Some little time. Why?"</p>

<p>"Pecause, I vosn't anxious to stay in this hole
any longer than vos necessary."</p>

<p>"Well, the fact is, in order to act intelligently in
the future, you have got to know exactly how matters
stand at present."</p>

<p>"Dot fellow vos dead fast enough, eh?"</p>

<p>"Great Cæsar! yes."</p>

<p>"Und I subbose dot rich young duffer vos ready
to bay vot he agreed like an honest man, eh?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"Vell, vhat more do I vont to know apout it,

<p>"A good deal&mdash;if you have any desire to keep
your neck from a hempen collar."</p>

<p>"Holy Moses! vhat do you mean, Parney, my

<p>"Listen quietly, and I will tell you."</p>

<p>"Go on, Parney, I will pe dumb."</p>

<p class="center">BARNEY HAWKS REVEALS A TERRIBLE SECRET&mdash;TRAPPED.</p>


<p>Old Spicer put out his hand and drew his young
companion close to his side, in order that he might
not lose a single word of what was about to be
spoken.</p>

<p>He felt, and so did George Morgan, that they
were about to hear revelations of the utmost importance.</p>

<p>Barney Hawks' first words, however, seemed a
little foreign to the subject.</p>

<p>"Hand me that flask again, Jake," he said, in a
tone of authority. "I must wet my whistle before
I begin."</p>

<p>Jake took out the flask and passed it across the
table without a word.</p>

<p>Barney took a liberal drink, and handing it back,
said:</p>

<p>"Take a drop yourself, Jake, you may feel the
need of it before I am through."</p>

<p>"So 'elp me gracious," muttered Jake, as he
glanced at the flask: "it vos only a drop I could dake
any how; dot vos all you hafe left me."</p>

<p>Barney seemed not to hear him, but hastened to
say:</p>

<p>"You know the little trick we played down the
road didn't work?"</p>

<p>"You mean putting der young station agent's
pody on der track?"</p>

<p>"Yes; we hoped it would be supposed he had
committed suicide, but as I say, our little game
didn't work."</p>

<p>"How vos dot?"</p>

<p>"The engineer and fireman of the freight train
both saw the body before they got to it; and while
they couldn't slow up in time to escape running
over it, they saw plainly enough that the man was
dead, or at least drugged, before he was placed on
the track."</p>

<p>"Dot vos pad."</p>

<p>"Yes; not only bad for us, but bad all around."</p>

<p>"What! do they suspect us, Parney?"</p>

<p>"No; but they are preparing to follow up certain
clews that may, in the end, lead to us."</p>

<p>"Holy Moses! Do they suspect der rich young
duffer?"</p>

<p>"Not yet. Just at present their suspicions point
to another rich fellow; but they may come round to
our man."</p>

<p>"Who's vorkin' up der case, Parney?"</p>

<p>"Nobody but Willett and Gaylord and a few common
detectives are at it as yet; but I understand Old
Spicer's going to take it up, and that's what makes
me feel uncomfortable."</p>

<p>"Old Spicer! Father Abraham help us!"</p>

<p>"We shall need his help, or the help of some powerful
saint, before we're through, I take it."</p>

<p>"I never quite understood the matter, any way,"
said Jake, in a thoughtful tone. "You asked me to
help you with the job, and I did it. What did they
want the young fellow put out of the way for, eh?"</p>

<p>"That's just what I was going to tell you."</p>

<p>"Well, Parney, drive on, vithout any more breface."</p>

<p>"All right! In the first place, then, you must
know that several years ago a certain family, named
Goddard, moved to Madison from New York. The
father was engaged in mining operations in the Far
West, and his family remained in the East.</p>

<p>"He had a beautiful daughter named Genevieve,
who used to be rather wild, and furnished delectable
gossip to Madison's staid matrons. She was not
only beautiful, but vivacious, and when some young
Hartford men camped out there, about six years
ago, two of them&mdash;one a wealthy young fellow
named Beach, and the other a rich gentleman whom
we will call&mdash;Emory&mdash;fell in love with her.</p>

<p>"Now the Way family lived in Madison, and
Charles Ives Way, who was then a romantic youth
of sixteen or seventeen, had seen Miss Goddard, and,
naturally, loved her&mdash;perhaps quite as much as
either of the other gentlemen I have named.</p>

<p>"Genevieve had played her cards well, and had
given both Beach and Emory, separately, cause to
think that he, and he alone, was all the world to
her.</p>

<p>"In carrying on her little game, she did her best
to make them both jealous; but, strange to say, she
never played them off against each other. For this
purpose she always used to encourage Charley Way.</p>

<p>"Finally she carried things with such a high
hand that, inside of two days, she had had fearful
rows with both Beach and Emory; and in the heat
of her anger she eloped with Way, and married him
in New York.</p>

<p>"Just what Beach did I don't pretend to know.
Emory went to her father and had a long private
talk with him. The result was, her parents made
her leave her husband, which, as I have an idea she
never really cared anything about him, I suppose
she did willingly enough.</p>

<p>"They took her out to Hot Springs, and while,
no doubt, Way loved her devotedly, he never attempted
to enforce his legal rights, and, so far as I
know, never saw his wife again.</p>

<p>"Agents from her father, agents from Beach,
and agents from our man, all in turn pestered him,
and tried to induce him to get a divorce, as the
woman had no grounds upon which to apply for
one; but nothing they could do or say would induce
him to procure a legal separation from her.</p>

<p>"At length our man became desperate. Mind!
I'm not saying now that Genevieve ever promised,
in case she should become free, to marry him; but I
fancy he had encouragement enough to satisfy him,
and he determined that she should be free.</p>

<p>"He sent another man to Way to reason with
him. He tried other means, and when everything
else failed, he sent for me."</p>

<p>"Und right avay, pooty quick, you sent for
me."</p>

<p>"Yes; as soon as I had completed my bargain with
him I sent for you."</p>

<p>"Und ve did de leetle schob."</p>

<p>"You're getting along too fast, Jake. First, we
looked over the ground. Since his wife had left
him, Way had gone into the railway business, and
was now station-agent at Stony Creek.</p>

<p>"It so happened that I knew a party over at
Leete's Island, close by."</p>

<p>"Peter Coffey, you mean?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and through him, without letting him suspect
too much, we were able to learn a good deal.
But, confound it, Jake, we have got Peter into the
hottest kind of hot water."</p>

<p>"Vos dot so?"</p>

<p>"It's just so; and if we can't get at him, and fix
matters right, he may let out something&mdash;tell of our
frequent visits to his place, and all that."</p>

<p>"Py gracious! I hope he von't pe so careless.
Put why do they susbect Peter?"</p>

<p>"For several reasons."</p>

<p>"Vell, vot vos one uv them?"</p>

<p>"A fellow named Howd claims to have been
drugged, and robbed of forty dollars in money at
Coffey's place, near the depot, several months ago.
And then, as even you and I must admit, Jake, he
is a pretty rough customer, any way."</p>

<p>"Yes, Parney; put all dot vosn't any evidence in
this case."</p>

<p>"No; but you see we put the body on the track
just at the point where a little path leads to Coffey's
house. We ought to have known better."</p>

<p>"Dot vos so. I'm surbrised at you, Parney."</p>

<p>"Then it seems that he left a package of sugar in
the depot, when we sent him there that night in
order to make sure of Way's movements. And the
morning after the murder, he was fool enough to go
and claim it."</p>

<p>"Holy Moses! vot an innocent!"</p>

<p>"But that isn't the worst."</p>

<p>"Father Abraham! what else?"</p>

<p>"He came to the city after he had sent home his
sugar, and he was heard to remark by two or three
persons that he was with Way three minutes before
the freight train went through, but that he would
not tell anything more about it for a clean thousand
dollars."</p>

<p>"Did he say dot, Parney?"</p>

<p>"So I understand."</p>

<p>"So 'elp me gracious! I will kill him before I am
a tay older."</p>

<p>"Hum! perhaps that wouldn't be such a bad idea,
Jake."</p>

<p>"I dell you, Parney Hawks, I will do it."</p>

<p>"I am perfectly willing, my dear boy."</p>

<p>"Dot settles it, then."</p>

<p>"All right. Do you remember that Clark that
we saw with Peter two or three times?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, they think he had a hand in the affair.
One woman, Mrs. Tyron, claims she saw him running
down the street just after the freight train
passed."</p>

<p>"Perhaps she did."</p>

<p>"Yes, and perhaps she didn't."</p>

<p>"Vell, let 'em think so, anyway. They may
hang him if they want to: I sha'n't stop 'em, Parney."</p>

<p>"Nor I, either; but I reckon he'll get out of it
easy enough."</p>

<p>"Has anything peen said apout der money ve
found?"</p>

<p>"Yes; it is claimed that the murderers got away
with one hundred and fifty dollars."</p>

<p>"Dot vos a mean lie; it vos only one hundred und
forty-nine tollars und seventy-eight cents. Vere
vos dot odder twenty-two cents?"</p>

<p>"You'd better ask 'em, Jake."</p>

<p>"No, thank you."</p>

<p>"By the way, where did you get the bottle of
whisky you had with you that night?"</p>

<p>"Hum&mdash;I ton't remember, Parney."</p>

<p>"Think."</p>

<p>"I can't think."</p>

<p>"You must."</p>

<p>"Vhy?"</p>

<p>"They have picked up the broken pieces of the
bottle, which, like a blasted fool, you left on the
track near the dead body, and now they're trying to
find the man who sold the whisky."</p>

<p>"They von't find him, then."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Pecause nopody never sold dot visky."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean dot I don't vos puy a tollar's worth uv
visky in den years."</p>

<p>"Thunder! I might have known that."</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"But where did you steal it, then?"</p>

<p>"I can't dell. In Shake Mann's, may pe."</p>

<p>"Can't you be sure?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Parney, it vos there. I remember now."</p>

<p>"All right, then. The place was crowded when
we were in there, and among so many he'll never
remember you."</p>

<p>"I'm villin' to pe forgotten, Parney."</p>

<p>"I should say so! And now about Way's revolver:
you got that, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Parney, I got dot."</p>

<p>"Where is it?"</p>

<p>"Right here in this vault."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"In my punk."</p>

<p>"Well, then, when we leave, you'd better take it
away and hide it in a safer place."</p>

<p>"Why so, Parney?"</p>

<p>"Because, they're hunting for that weapon sharp,
and it wouldn't do to have it found here, or on your
person."</p>

<p>"All right, I'll dake it vith me, und hide it as
soon as I get home."</p>

<p>"See that you do, Jake."</p>

<p>"I vill, Parney, so 'elp me gracious."</p>

<p>"Now, one thing more," said Barney, after a moment's
pause, "and then we must be off. Have
you seen Sadie Seaton since we parted last?"</p>

<p>"Yes," admitted Jake, somewhat reluctantly.</p>

<p>"She sent word to Hen about the old woman's
money, didn't she?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"How much does she claim the old gal had by
her?"</p>

<p>Jake Klinkhammer hesitated.</p>

<p>Barney regarded him for a moment with stern
displeasure, and then, in a threatening voice, said:</p>

<p>"None of that, Jake. It won't do, you know.
You remember who first put us on the track of this
affair, and it don't make any difference if Hen and
his pal did get in ahead of us, they've got to divide;
and you and I are going to divide whatever they
pay us, mind that, my boy."</p>

<p>"Vell, vell, Parney, dot vos all right; we'll divy."</p>

<p>"Then answer my question. How much of a
haul is it likely they made?"</p>

<p>"Sixteen t'ousand, sure, and maype twenty t'ousand."</p>

<p>"Hum, well, say sixteen thousand, that ain't so
very bad."</p>

<p>"No, dot vos not so wery pad."</p>

<p>"It'll be four thousand a piece, you know."</p>

<p>"Und if it vos twenty t'ousand, vot then?"</p>

<p>"Why, then, I suppose we ought to give each of
them an extra thousand, as they've had all the
risk."</p>

<p>"Vell, dot vos all right, for then they vould hav'
five t'ousand, und <i>ve</i> would hav' each five t'ousand,
too."</p>

<p>"Hum, that's so; and five thousand ought to
satisfy them."</p>

<p>"Py gracious, yes!"</p>

<p>"Where can we find 'em, Jake?"</p>

<p>Again the Hebrew hesitated. But a threatening
look from Barney speedily brought him to his
senses.</p>

<p>"Hen vos sthoppin' somevhere on Sixth Avenue,
mit a girl," he said, hastily. "I don't vos remember
her name. I vill ask Sadie."</p>

<p>"She wrote to him there, did she?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I dink so."</p>

<p>"Ain't you sure?"</p>

<p>"Not quite."</p>

<p>"How's that?"</p>

<p>"Dere vos von odder blace he had letters sent to
somedimes. I vill find out dot blace."</p>

<p>"See that you do. And look you, Jake, may be
it will be as well for us to pay New York a visit in
company to-morrow. This town is getting a little
hot for us, and we want money&mdash;want it badly; and
we can see Hen and his pal, and make Emory meet
us there at the same time&mdash;kill two birds with one
stone, you understand."</p>

<p>"Yes, Parney, I dink ve petter go to New York."</p>

<p>"Well, then, that's settled. Now get your little
gun and come along."</p>

<p>Jake started to his feet, crossed to the tier of
bunks behind which the detectives were concealed,
and began searching under the pillow of the middle
bunk.</p>

<p>Presently he became greatly excited, and pulling
up the bed itself, felt eagerly all over the bottom of
the bunk.</p>

<p>"What in thunder's the matter?" demanded Barney,
at last, impatiently.</p>

<p>"Py Father Abraham! dot pistols vos gone!"
gasped Jake. "Dot vos vhat vos der matter."</p>

<p>"Gone? The devil!"</p>

<p>"Yes; und some uv my bapers vos gone, too."</p>

<p>"Papers? What papers?"</p>

<p>"Noddings put some leetle memorandums."</p>

<p>"Memorandums of what?"</p>

<p>"Of some moneys und jewels I hid in der leetle
vault beyond."</p>

<p>"Have you got any wealth concealed in the little
vault?"</p>

<p>"Schust a leetle, Parney&mdash;not much. It vos
schust my share in der last boodle und der von pefore
dot."</p>

<p>"Well, whatever it is, you'd better go and get it
at once. If that revolver is gone, it isn't at all
likely we'll want to visit this place again in a
hurry."</p>

<p>"Dot vos so, Parney."</p>

<p>"Come on, then. Move the bunks aside. That's
right&mdash;go ahead. I'll hold the light."</p>

<p>Jake squeezed his way behind the bunks, and
throwing open the door, entered the inner vault,
closely followed by Barney, bearing the light.</p>

<p>They took a step forward; but only to have the
muzzles of two revolvers thrust into their faces,
and to hear a voice, in stern and threatening tones,
exclaim:</p>

<p>"You were looking for poor Charley Way's revolver
a moment ago. Here it is! Will you have
the contents now? You have only to move hand or
foot, and they are yours, I swear it!"</p>

<p>"Old Spicer, by Jove!" ejaculated Barney, in a
tone of chagrin.</p>

<p>"It vos, so 'elp me gracious!" groaned Jake, in a
voice of despair.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>

<p class="center">THE SITUATION CHANGED&mdash;OLD SPICER STARTS FOR
NEW YORK.</p>


<p>Barney Hawks stood just behind Jake Klinkhammer,
and a little to the right of him.</p>

<p>As he uttered the great detective's name, the
light he carried dropped from his hand and almost
instantly expired, leaving the place in total darkness.</p>

<p>The next moment he grasped Jake by the arm,
and whispering the single word "burrow" in his
ear, slipped around the bunks and disappeared.</p>

<p>Old Spicer fired two shots and Morgan one.</p>

<p>At the second shot, Jake Klinkhammer fell, with
a dismal groan. And hastily calling upon George
to light their own lamp, the old detective stooped
down to raise up the supposed wounded man.</p>

<p>To his surprise, he could not find him, and the
lamp which George by this time succeeded in lighting,
revealed the fact that he too had disappeared.</p>

<p>An earnest and vigorous search for the murderers
was now begun; but after a quarter of an hour
had passed, not the slightest signs of them had
been discovered.</p>

<p>"Where can they have escaped to so suddenly?"
exclaimed George, impatiently. "Surely they did
not get through the Ernst basement."</p>

<p>"No, nor by the other tunnel either," returned
Spicer. "There must be a secret passage we have
not found yet."</p>

<p>"Well, what shall we do? They're gone clean
enough by this time, that's certain."</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure of that," said Spicer; "but
whether or no, there's one thing we'd better do
while we're here."</p>

<p>"What's that, sir?"</p>

<p>"Find the Hebrew's stolen treasure, and in fact,
everything else we may have overlooked in our
previous search. Now that they have got away
from us, and know we have discovered their secret,
they won't leave anything here that we may pass
over."</p>

<p>"That's true enough. But do you really think
they may yet be in one or the other of these
vaults?"</p>

<p>"I think it's quite possible."</p>

<p>"Then suppose only one of us hunts for the
treasure, while the other searches for the murderers."</p>

<p>"Very good, which task do you prefer?"</p>

<p>"To hunt for the villains."</p>

<p>"Very good again. Only let me warn you,
don't let them get a shot at you from some dark recess."</p>

<p>"I'll look out for that;" and Morgan recommenced
his search for the fugitives, while Old
Spicer began looking for Jake Klinkhammer's
treasure.</p>

<p>He soon found it, and, to his utmost astonishment,
found that it consisted of $13,782 in gold and
national bank notes, and watches, diamonds and
jewelry to the value of at least $5,000 more.</p>

<p>"A big haul!" he exclaimed, "and with the
memoranda I found, I shall be enabled to return
by far the greater portion of it to its rightful
owners."</p>

<p>He then went over the two vaults, inch by inch,
but discovered very little more of importance.</p>

<p>Then, as Morgan had found no traces of the murderers,
he decided to return to the outer world, and,
after a conference with Stricket, and perhaps with
the coroner, to put in operation a plan that he had
been maturing in his mind for the past half hour.</p>

<p>Morgan followed the old detective with some reluctance.
He could not bear to think that such consummate
villains as the two who had so cleverly
eluded them, should be allowed to make their escape.
But he was forced to admit that he could give no
good reason why they should remain longer under
ground, and so, slowly, he followed Old Spicer
through the tunnel into the sub-cellar, and from
thence into the coal-vault and through the coal-hole,
and so into the upper world.</p>

<p>On emerging from the passageway into York
Street, they saw a cab passing. Old Spicer immediately
hailed it, and, when they were seated inside,
requested the jehu to drive as fast as his horse could
go down Chapel Street.</p>

<p>"Where to?" asked Jehu, curiously.</p>

<p>"Go till I tell you to stop," was the reply, and the
horse started.</p>

<p>In front of the Western Union Telegraph Company's
office, Old Spicer gave the signal to stop; and,
springing from the cab, he rushed into the office,
scratched thirteen words on a blank, and, handing
it to the operator, said:</p>

<p>"Get that off at once. It's on a matter of life and
death."</p>

<p>The operator took the dispatch, and this is what
he read:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<i>Adam Killett, 300 Mulberry Street, New York</i>:</p>

<p>"Meet me at Grand Central depot on arrival of
four-eleven morning train.</p>

<p class="right">
"<span class="smcap">Spicer.</span>"<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>"All right, sir," said the operator, "it shall go
this minute."</p>

<p>"And mind!" said Old Spicer, "if he isn't at the
office, as it's hardly likely he will be at this hour,
have it taken to him wherever he may be; understand?"</p>

<p>"All right, sir; but I shall have to charge for
sending the instructions."</p>

<p>"Charge what you have a mind to, but see to it
that Mr. Killett gets that dispatch, that's all I care
about it."</p>

<p>"He shall surely get it, sir."</p>

<p>"Thanks. It will greatly oblige me. Good-night,"
and hurrying from the office, he leaped into
the cab, and calling out "Home Place," sank into
his corner, and never spoke again till they arrived
before his door.</p>

<p>"Wait," he said to the driver, as they alighted,
"I shall want you to take me to the depot in ten
minutes&mdash;come in, George, I want to talk with you
and Seth," and he led the way straight to the back
parlor.</p>

<p>Seth Stricket was still fast asleep on the lounge.</p>

<p>"Wake up, Seth!" said Old Spicer, giving him a
vigorous shake. "You've had a long nap."</p>

<p>"What! back already?" demanded Seth, slowly
raising himself to a sitting posture.</p>

<p>"Already? Why, man, it's all of three hours
and a half since we left you."</p>

<p>"Is it possible!"</p>

<p>"It is indeed. And now, Seth, I want to talk to
you. I have only time to say a few words, for I
take the next train for New York&mdash;must start in ten
minutes."</p>

<p>"The deuce! What's up?"</p>

<p>"We have learned that Mrs. Ernst's murderers
came up from New York. Doubtless they have returned
to the city again, and I must find them before
they receive warning of my coming from two
of their friends, whom George and I disturbed to-night."</p>

<p>"But did not capture?"</p>

<p>"As to that, George will explain when I am gone.
But listen: While I am away, you are to bend all
your energies toward retaking Barney Hawks and
Jake Klinkhammer, and to find out who a certain
Beach and a certain Emory may be, who camped
out on the Madison sea-shore six summers ago.
George will explain the rest."</p>

<p>"All right, sir."</p>

<p>"This treasure, George," continued Old Spicer,
producing the Jew's boodle, "I wish you would
place in the vaults of the Safe Deposit Company, as
soon as they open in the morning."</p>

<p>"I'll attend to it, sir."</p>

<p>"Thanks. And now I must be off," and he started
for the door.</p>

<p>"Stay!" exclaimed Stricket. "Supposing we
should want to communicate with you, where will
a letter or dispatch reach you?"</p>

<p>"Care of Inspector Byrnes, 300 Mulberry Street.
If you want to get word to me, use the wires, and
use them freely. Time is everything to us, you
know. And now good-bye."</p>

<p>"Good-bye, sir, and good luck."</p>

<p>"Thanks, the same to you," and Old Spicer hurried
from the house.</p>

<p>"Now, then, driver," he said, as he sprung into
the cab, "I can ride as fast as your horse can go."</p>

<p>"All right, sir," and they were off.</p>

<p>Eight minutes later the indefatigable detective
had taken his seat in the train, which was moving
from the Union depot on its way to New York.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>

<p class="center">ON THE EVE OF A TERRIBLE CRIME.</p>


<p>Old Spicer and Morgan had hardly passed out of
the tunnel into the sub-cellar, when the little flight
of five steps, leading from the trap under the table
to the entrance of the tunnel, was thrown forward,
revealing a hole about two and one-half feet high
by nearly three feet wide&mdash;a veritable burrow.</p>

<p>Out of this hole first crawled Jake Klinkhammer,
and when he had raised himself to the floor of the
vault, Barney Hawks followed him, carefully restoring
the steps to their place, however, before he
crawled out from under the table.</p>

<p>"Where is there another light, Jake?" asked
Barney, "I broke the one we had, you know."</p>

<p>"Lemme see," mused Jake. "Oh! dere vos some
candles in der lower punk, on dot side. You find
'em?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Barney, after feeling in the
place indicated, "here they are. Now, have you a
match?"</p>

<p>"Yes," and, lighting one, the Jew came forward
and communicated the flame to the candle.</p>

<p>"Now," said Barney, "let's see if they have
found your little boodle," and the two hurried into
the inner vault.</p>

<p>A single glance was sufficient to inform Jake of
his heavy loss, and a more unhappy Jew never cut
a throat or relieved a poor widow of her hard earnings.</p>

<p>"Oh, Father Abraham!" he groaned, "I vos a
ruined man. Vot schall I do? Oh, holy Moses!
schust help me to catch dot tamned Old Spicer, und
I vill not ask uv you one odder favor so long as I
live.</p>

<p>"Great Aaron! all der hard earnings uv a life-time
gone. I vos schust ready to lay me town und
die. Yes, dere vos no use living any more."</p>

<p>"It is mighty hard, Jake, to lose all your <i>honest</i>
earnings in this way," said Barney. "But cheer
up, my boy; you've escaped with a whole skin, and
we may live to get even with Old Spicer yet."</p>

<p>"I vould schust like to r-r-r-ring his tamned
neck!" hissed Jake. "I vould schust like to trink
his l-l-l-life blood!"</p>

<p>"You would like that, eh?"</p>

<p>"So 'elp me gracious, dot vould make me feel
happy."</p>

<p>"Well, we will lay low for him one of these days,
but just now we must see Sadie, and after we have
seen her we must be off to New York."</p>

<p>"I vos ready for anyting now," sighed Jake; "I
vos desperate!"</p>

<p>"That won't do, old fellow; brace up! There are
plenty more yellow boys to be had where those
came from. Pshaw! in another week we shall both
be rotten with wealth."</p>

<p>"Maype so; I don't care."</p>

<p>"But you want to get even with that long, thin
church-spire of a detective, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; und with der odder von, too."</p>

<p>"All right. Come on, then."</p>

<p>They descended into the tunnel, carefully closing
the trap-door after them.</p>

<p>Just before reaching the sub-cellar, Barney came
to an abrupt halt.</p>

<p>"Suppose," said he, "they have placed a watch
at both of the outlets?"</p>

<p>"Dot vos schust vhat dey hav' done, ov course,"
responded Jake, in a matter-of-fact tone.</p>

<p>"Then, in the demon's name, how are we going to
get out?"</p>

<p>"Give it op," returned Jake, indifferently.</p>

<p>Barney regarded his companion with a look of
surprise.</p>

<p>"Thunder!" he exclaimed, "do you let the loss of
a little money affect you in that way? Are you
willing to die&mdash;to be hanged, just because a little
bad luck has overtaken you?"</p>

<p>"Might schust as vell die as to pe vidout gold,"
answered Jake, doggedly.</p>

<p>"Well," said Barney, resignedly, "I see I've got
the thinking to do for both of us, and I take it I can
put you in the way of getting at least a part of your
wealth back again in short order."</p>

<p>Jake pricked up his ears.</p>

<p>"How vos dot, Parney?" he asked, with some
show of interest.</p>

<p>"You've got your shooting-irons about you, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And that bloody knife of yours?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then follow me and keep your eye open."</p>

<p>"I'm vith you, Parney, vherever you lead, so long
as dere vos gold at der end uv der journey."</p>

<p>To this Barney did not reply; but starting on, he
opened the door into the sub-cellar, and instead of
turning either toward the coal vault or opening into
the disused sewer, conducted his companion to the
stairs leading to the basement of the house.</p>

<p>These stairs they ascended, but found the door at
the top locked.</p>

<p>Barney at once took a pair of key-nippers from his
pocket, and fastening them to the key which was in
the lock, turned it, and immediately opened the
door.</p>

<p>They then, cautiously, ascended to the principal
floor, and from thence to the second floor, and so on,
to the roof of the house.</p>

<p>Crouching down, they crawled along the roof
until they had reached the particular house Barney
had in mind, and here they stopped before the scuttle
and attempted to raise it.</p>

<p>It was firmly fastened on the under side.</p>

<p>Barney promptly took two jimmies from an inside
pocket of his coat, and passing one to Jake,
directed him to insert it under one corner of the
scuttle door, while he did the same at the opposite
corner.</p>

<p>"Ready?" he presently asked.</p>

<p>"All ready," was the answer.</p>

<p>"Up with her then!" and both bearing down on
the jimmies at the same time, the staples underneath
gave way with the utmost ease, and the scuttle-door
flew open.</p>

<p>"Dot vos all right," exclaimed Jake. "Now
what next?"</p>

<p>"Listen," said Barney, "I have learned that in
the room I am going to take you to there is a
strong safe, containing at this present moment
$33,500."</p>

<p>"Dhirty-dree t'ousand and 'vive hundred tollars!
Vos der really so much as dot, Parney?"</p>

<p>"Possibly there is a little more or a little less;
but you'll find I am not very far out of the way."</p>

<p>"Whose money vos it?"</p>

<p>"It belongs to the Eastern stock-holders of the
Eagle Gold Mining Company, of Arizona, and has
been sent on here to their treasurer and agent, Mr.
John Marsden, to be used by him in paying their
next quarterly dividend."</p>

<p>"So 'elp me gracious! I dink dey vill hav' to pass
dot next dividend, Parney, eh?"</p>

<p>"It strikes me that way."</p>

<p>"Vhere vos dot safe?"</p>

<p>"Ah! there's the rub, and that's what I must fully
explain."</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"Well, you see Marsden and his wife occupy a
sleeping-apartment on the second floor. Beyond
this sleeping-room is another and smaller apartment,
which is used by Marsden as a sort of study and
private office, the only means of access to which is
through the sleeping-room."</p>

<p>"Und in this inner room vos der safe, eh, Parney?"</p>

<p>"Exactly."</p>

<p>"Then ve hav' to go right py Mr. Marsden's
ped, and run der risk uv wakin' him und his
vife?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Vell, dot vos all right, if ve vos <i>sure</i> dere vos
dhirty dousand tollars in dot safes."</p>

<p>"There's not the shadow of a doubt of it. The
money was paid to Marsden at noon to-day, or rather
yesterday, as it is now past midnight."</p>

<p>"Put vhy didn't he put it in der pank?"</p>

<p>"He's a queer fellow&mdash;rich and very eccentric;
has had a row with every bank president in the city,
and swears that not one of them shall ever handle
another dollar that he controls. He expects to take
the greater part of the money to Meriden and Hartford
to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Py gracious, Parney! ve vill safe him dot
trouples, ha, ha!"</p>

<p>"We will try to, at any rate. And now come
on."</p>

<p>"One moment, Parney. Suppose they should
vake up."</p>

<p>"Hum, I wish we had a little chloroform with
us."</p>

<p>"Yes, put ve ha'n't got von trop."</p>

<p>"No, and so&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Und so if either uv dem underdake to make
trouples, vhy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, you must silence them in the easiest way
you can."</p>

<p>"Dot vos all right Parney&mdash;you shust leave dot to
me."</p>

<p>"Very good. And now come on. I'm mighty
glad to see you in a more cheerful mood, Jake."</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! Der brospects uv handling dhirty-dree
dousand tollars vas enough to make any man cheerful.
Vosn't dot so, my tear Parney?"</p>

<p>"Well, there <i>is</i> a cheering sound in the clinking
of gold, I must confess. Now, then, I'll go ahead,
and you keep close to my heels."</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>"Better close the scuttle, Jake."</p>

<p>"Dot's schust vot I am a-doin'," and Jake closed
and fastened the scuttle while Barney waited for
him on the attic floor below.</p>

<p>Not having a lantern, Barney now lighted a piece
of candle he had brought with him, and the two
burglars descended the attic stairs to the third
story.</p>

<p>Treading cautiously and lightly, they traversed the
hall and descended to the second floor.</p>

<p>Here Barney paused before a closed door and listened
intently.</p>

<p>Then, after a rapid signal to Jake, he put out the
light and turned the knob.</p>

<p>The door was locked on the inside.</p>

<p>Once more he had recourse to his nippers, and
speedily the door was opened.</p>

<p>Evidently Barney knew exactly where the door to
the inner room was situated; for, without the slightest
hesitation, he started across the sleeping-apartment
in a diagonal direction.</p>

<p>Jake essayed to follow him, but mistaking the
course, brought up against the foot of the bed, which
he struck with such force as to startle the sleepers
from their dreams, and cause a red-hot oath to burst
from his own lips.</p>

<p>"Who's there?" came in a stern and determined
voice from the bed. "Speak! or by the great Eternal!
I'll fire!"</p>

<p>There was the slightest possible movement at
the foot of the bed, and then, just as the mining
company's treasurer was about to pull the trigger, a
blow descended on his breast, and he fell over dead,
bathed in his own heart's blood.</p>

<p>His wife heard the blow, heard the revolver drop
from his hand, and felt the jar as her husband fell
dead by her side.</p>

<p>A cry of fear and agony arose to her lips; but ere
she could give it utterance, a hand closed about her
throat, and speedily she lost all consciousness.</p>

<p>"It vos all right now, Parney. You can sthrike
a light as soon as you vant to," whispered Jake
cheerfully. "These two von't give us no more
trouple."</p>

<p>Barney hastened to light a candle, and then,
having cautioned Jake to lock the bedroom door,
entered the inner room, and began a careful examination
of the safe.</p>

<p>It had not a combination lock, and he had only to
find the key to be able to open it with the greatest
ease.</p>

<p>An instant's reflection satisfied him that the key
would most probably be in one of the dead man's
trousers pockets.</p>

<p>Hurrying back, therefore, into the bedroom, he
looked around for that useful article of wearing apparel.</p>

<p>He soon found it, and in the right-hand pocket
found the key on a bunch with a dozen others.</p>

<p>In another moment he was back to the safe, and
had the door open.</p>

<p>By this time Jake was at his side, and as Barney
opened drawer after drawer, and brought forth
packages of bank-notes and bags of specie, his excitement
was intense and his happiness almost complete.</p>

<p>At length the safe was stripped, and the treasure
had been carefully stowed away in the capacious
pockets of the two burglars.</p>

<p>Barney was just shutting the safe door, and Jake
was making sure that not a single gold piece had
been dropped upon the floor, when a deep and
hollow groan from the next room startled them
both.</p>

<p>"Great Cæsar! what was that?" gasped Barney.</p>

<p>"Father Abraham! but it vos der dead man's
ghost," muttered Jake, with a shiver.</p>

<p>"Did&mdash;did you kill the woman?" Barney at length
managed to stammer forth.</p>

<p>"No, Parney; I only schust choked her a leetle."</p>

<p>"Oh, ah! <i>that's</i> it, then," exclaimed the other,
greatly relieved. "Go back and gag her, or she'll
be coming to and having the whole house roused
before we can get out of it, confound her!"</p>

<p>Jake readily undertook this mission, and seizing
a bed-sheet, endeavored to stuff it into the woman's
mouth.</p>

<p>But she had already recovered consciousness; and
clinching her teeth tight together, resisted all his
efforts to gag her.</p>

<p>At length, growing impatient and desperate, he
once more grasped her by the throat, and when at
last he released his hold, there was no longer any
necessity for filling her mouth with the sheet. Her
spirit had gone to join that of her murdered husband.</p>

<p>"Have you fixed her, Jake?" asked Barney, approaching
the bed.</p>

<p>"Schust hold der light here till ve see."</p>

<p>Barney advanced with the candle.</p>

<p>"Yes, dot vos all right," said the Jew, complacently.
"She von't make no more noise ter-night,
I pet you."</p>

<p>"By Jove, Jake," exclaimed Barney, with some
show of compunction, "I'm afraid we've carried
this thing a little too far&mdash;further, in fact, than there
was any necessity for."</p>

<p>"Schust look you, Parney. If I hadn't done for
der man, he would have finished me, you pet, pesides
rousing der bolice vid his tamned bistols.
Und as for der old gal, she wouldn't open her
mouth, und so, as it vos growin' light, and ve
hadn't no time to tarry here, vy, I schust choked her a
leetle und dot vos der last uv her. How vos <i>I</i> to
know dot she would schlip her vind so easy?"</p>

<p>"Well, well, we've no time to dispute about the
matter now. Let's get to Sadie's place the easiest
way we can, and then settle how we shall get down
to New York."</p>

<p>"All right, I'm villing," and unlocking the bedroom
door, and locking it again from the outside,
they hurried down to the main hall, taking the key
with them.</p>

<p>Cautiously Barney unlocked the outside door and
peered into the street. There was not a living soul
in sight.</p>

<p>"Vos it safe to venture out?" asked Jake in a
whisper.</p>

<p>"I don't know; I see no one," was the answer.</p>

<p>"Vait a minute!" exclaimed Jake, approaching
the hat-rack. "Schust you put on dot great coat
and blug hat, and I vill put on dese."</p>

<p>"The very thing!" cried Barney, in a tone of satisfaction;
and seizing the murdered man's overcoat
and hat, he put them on, while Jake appropriated a
smaller coat and a Derby.</p>

<p>Their own soft hats they thrust into their pockets,
knowing too much to leave them behind.</p>

<p>"Now," said Barney, "we may venture forth," and
noiselessly opening the door, they stepped outside,
closing the door behind them.</p>

<p>After listening for a moment in the shadow of the
porch, they glided down the steps, and hurried up
the street, Jake a dozen feet or so in advance of Barney.</p>

<p>They met no one; and in less than ten minutes
were before Sadie Seaton's door.</p>

<p>Jake rang the bell, but was quickly satisfied that
the peal had not roused the slumbering Sadie.</p>

<p>He was about to ring again, when Barney exclaimed,
warningly:</p>

<p>"Hold up! here comes some one. We'd better
not be seen here."</p>

<p>"Dot vos so," assented Jake. "Come round to
der pack door."</p>

<p>"Good, we'll do that. There's only a lock there&mdash;no
bolts, and if the door's fastened, I'll soon open
it."</p>

<p>"Put ve'd petter know who's coming," suggested
Jake.</p>

<p>"You're right, my boy; we'll hide round the corner
of the house here, and see who passes."</p>

<p>They had hardly concealed themselves, when two
men arrived in front of the place and slowly passed.</p>

<p>"Seth Stricket!" exclaimed Barney, as soon as
they were out of hearing.</p>

<p>"Und dot meddlin' George Morgan, confound
him!" added his companion.</p>

<p>"Well, let 'em go," said Barney. "If they are
looking for us, I fancy they won't find us."</p>

<p>"No, not schust yet, anyvay. Come," and they
hurried round to the back door.</p>

<p>This time they did not wait to ring or knock, but
using his nippers, Barney speedily opened the way
for them to enter the house, and they entered accordingly,
closing and locking the door after them.</p>

<p>Jake, as one familiar with the premises, led the
way to the second story; and entering a sitting-room,
lighted the gas, and then approaching a bedroom
door, knocked.</p>

<p>After the knocking was repeated, a little more impatiently,
a voice demanded in no very pleasant
tone:</p>

<p>"Who's there, and what do you want?"</p>

<p>"It vos me, my tear," answered Jake; "und I
vont your own sweet self, und dot tamned quick,
too."</p>

<p>"What! is it you, Jake? How did you get in?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it vos me, I told you, und I valked in."</p>

<p>"I'll be out in a minute," and sure enough in less
than a minute a very pretty girl, not more than
nineteen years of age, clothed in a dressing-gown
and slippers, made her appearance.</p>

<p>"Ah! you are not alone!" she exclaimed, starting
back at sight of Barney.</p>

<p>"No, my tear, dis vos my friend, Parney Hawks;
you know him, I pelieve?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have seen him before, and am very glad
to see him now. What can I do for you, gentlemen?"</p>

<p>"Vos dere any whiskey in der house, my tear?"</p>

<p>"I think there is a little. I will go and see. Take
seats, please."</p>

<p>"Vid der greatest bleasure, I assure you. Put
first, my tear, how vos der vinders?"</p>

<p>"All right, the blinds are tightly closed, and, as
you see, the curtains are drawn."</p>

<p>"Dot vos goot. Now hurry up vid der whiskey."</p>

<p>The girl went out, and soon returned with a bottle
and three glasses on a salver.</p>

<p>"Dot vos right, my tear, you will trink vid us."</p>

<p>"Of course;" and setting the salver down on a
center-table, she took a chair near the Jew.</p>

<p>He filled the three glasses, and handed her one.</p>

<p>"Your health, my tear," he said, taking a swallow
of his own.</p>

<p>"And yours," she replied. Then in another
tone:</p>

<p>"What's the news, Jake? What brings you here
at this time of night?"</p>

<p>"Vhat should pring me here put der desire to see
your own sweet face."</p>

<p>"Get out, I know better than that. Besides, if
you had only come to see me, you wouldn't have
brought your friend with you."</p>

<p>"Vell, dot vos apout so, Sadie."</p>

<p>"Then what's up? Why don't you tell me?"</p>

<p>"You vos still feelin' a leetle interest in your old
lover, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Do you mean Hen?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I mean Hen."</p>

<p>The girl blushed slightly.</p>

<p>"Of course I feel some interest in his welfare,"
she said; "that's but natural."</p>

<p>"Quite natural, my tear&mdash;quite so. Und you
vould like to see him brosper, eh?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean? What are you driving at,
Jake?"</p>

<p>"You know you dold me you gave him some hint
of der old voman's gold."</p>

<p>Sadie started, and cast a glance of apprehension
toward Barney.</p>

<p>"Oh, dot vos all right, Sadie. Parney was Hen's
barticular friend, und he schust heard to-night dot
der bolice hav' tumbled to his leetle racket, und are
goin' ter arrest him in New York, so he vos awful
anxious to see him und put him on his guard."</p>

<p>"Why don't he see him, then?"</p>

<p>"For a very goot reason; he ain't quite certain
where to find him."</p>

<p>Sadie became very thoughtful.</p>

<p>At length she turned to Barney, and asked:</p>

<p>"What do you want&mdash;what do you expect of
me?"</p>

<p>"You know where Hen is most likely to be
found?" he said.</p>

<p>"I suppose so."</p>

<p>"Tell us, then; it may be the means of saving
him from the gallows."</p>

<p>The girl started.</p>

<p>"Is there any danger of that?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Danger?" exclaimed Jake. "I should schust
say so!"</p>

<p>"Do <i>you</i> think so?" she demanded, turning once
more to Barney.</p>

<p>"I reckon Old Spicer's on his track," he answered;
"and if that's so, his only chance is my
getting to him before that old rat can find him."</p>

<p>The girl looked distressed.</p>

<p>"I don't know what to do," she said. "Hen
made me take an oath that I would give his address
to no one, and that I would not let even his
best friend know the places he frequents in New
York."</p>

<p>"Well, my dear, of course you can do exactly as
you have a mind to about it; but if you don't tell
us, his chances of escaping the hangman are pretty
slim, I can assure you that." Then turning to his
friend, with a solemn air:</p>

<p>"Come, Jake, we must be going; it won't do to
linger here any longer."</p>

<p>"Dot vos so!" exclaimed the wily Jew, starting to
his feet.</p>

<p class="center">BARNEY AND JAKE START FOR NEW YORK.</p>


<p>"Oh, dear! oh, dear! What shall I do? What
shall I do?" moaned the poor girl in great distress.</p>

<p>"Do?" exclaimed Jake. "Why, put us on der
fellow's drack, und so, if you care anything apout
him, save his life."</p>

<p>"I will tell," she exclaimed, taking a sudden
resolution&mdash;"at least I will put you in the way of
finding him."</p>

<p>"All right, my tear, drive on, und pe quick

<p>"That's so," said Barney.</p>

<p>"Do you know where Hudson Street is?" asked
Sadie.</p>

<p>Barney nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jake, "ve know."</p>

<p>"Well," continued Sadie, "at No. 515 there is a
saloon."</p>

<p>"Who keeps it?"</p>

<p>"A fellow named Taylor."</p>

<p>"Hain't been there long, I reckon?"</p>

<p>"Not so very long, I believe."</p>

<p>"Is he a young fellow?"</p>

<p>"Yes, not more than twenty-one or twenty-two."</p>

<p>"Is he Hen's pal?"</p>

<p>"And we can hear of him at this saloon?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"He's got a lady friend in New York, hasn't
he?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I believe so," faltered poor Sadie.</p>

<p>"Know her name?"</p>

<p>"I believe it's Bell."</p>

<p>"Bell what?"</p>

<p>"No! no! Bell is her last name."</p>

<p>"Oh! is it Cora Bell?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's it."</p>

<p>"Does she live on Sixth Avenue?"</p>

<p>"I believe so."</p>

<p>"Know the number?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;there! I mustn't tell you any more."</p>

<p>"No matter, I can find her if I should happen to
want to see her. But one question more: Hen isn't
Hen when he travels in New York, I'm told?"</p>

<p>"No, not always, I believe."</p>

<p>"How do you address your letters when you write
to him?"</p>

<p>She considered for a moment.</p>

<p>"Of course you are really his friends," she said at
last, "and I will tell you."</p>

<p>"Well, we are somewhat anxious to know."</p>

<p>"In New York he goes by the name of Frank
Clark."</p>

<p>"Frank Clark! Ah! of course. I ought to have
remembered that. Come, Jake, one more drink,
and then we must really tear ourselves away from
this lovely young lady."</p>

<p>They filled their glasses, drained them, and prepared
to go.</p>

<p>"What! are you both going?" asked Sadie, regarding
them with a look of disappointment.</p>

<p>"We must go," said Barney. But understanding
her look, he quickly turned to his companion
and added:</p>

<p>"Come, Jake, you wouldn't drink the lady's liquor
and leave nothing in its place, I hope. Come!
come! old fellow, be generous for once in your life,
and give her a yellow boy."</p>

<p>Jake looked annoyed; but with the best grace possible,
pulled out one of the Eagle Gold Mining Company's
ten-dollar gold pieces, and throwing it into
Sadie's lap, said:</p>

<p>"There, my tear, don't never say I vos gif you
noddings."</p>

<p>"And there, my beauty," added Barney, tossing
another gold piece to her. "Please, hereafter set
me down among your friends."</p>

<p>"Oh! thank you&mdash;thank you both," she exclaimed,
fervently. "God knows I needed this,"
and bursting into tears, the poor girl fled from the
room.</p>

<p>"Come," said Barney, hurriedly, "we'd better get
away while we can," and slipping down-stairs, they
went out at the side door.</p>

<p>"Vell, vhich vay now?" asked Jake, as they hurried
down the street.</p>

<p>"I've been thinking," responded Barney, "and if
the thing can be managed, we ought not to take the
train anywhere this side of Milford."</p>

<p>"I can manage it," said Jake, quietly.</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"I know a livery-stable keeper vot vos all right."</p>

<p>"Who is he?"</p>

<p>"Isaac Rosenwasser."</p>

<p>"Where's his place?"</p>

<p>"On George Street; und, so 'elp me gracious,
dere vos vun uv his carriages now, on dot corner."</p>

<p>"Do you know the driver?"</p>

<p>"I vill run und see. He vos in dot saloon, I
guess."</p>

<p>Jake hurried across the street and peered into
the saloon.</p>

<p>The driver was there, and he knew him.</p>

<p>He called him out, beckoned to Barney, and
sprung into the carriage.</p>

<p>"Where to, Jake?" asked the driver.</p>

<p>"Go out Congress Avenue, und then I vill told
you."</p>

<p>The driver took the direction named, and in due
time had crossed West Bridge and entered the town
of Orange.</p>

<p>"Where now?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Old Milford," was the brief reply.</p>

<p>"The devil!" exclaimed the driver, "you're giving
me a pretty job at this hour in the morning."</p>

<p>"Never mind, my tear fellow," said Jake, encouragingly,
"ve vill make it all right vid you."</p>

<p>"All right it is, then," cried the driver, cheerfully,
and he started his horses toward the Milford turnpike.</p>

<p>Slowly they ascended the long hill, passed the old
toll-gate, and then were fairly on the way to the
station from whence they hoped to start for New
York.</p>

<p>In due time they reached the place, dismissed the
driver with a liberal fee, and when the local express
came along sprung aboard.</p>

<p>Two hours later they landed in the Grand Central
Depot, and without loss of time started for Hudson
Street.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>

<p class="center">OLD SPICER AND KILLETT IN TAYLOR'S SALOON.</p>


<p>As Old Spicer stepped from the train in the Grand
Central Depot, a hand closed about his arm and he
was drawn out of the crowd and led by a roundabout
way into Vanderbilt Avenue, and so into a quiet
room of the hotel on the corner.</p>

<p>"That was very well done, Adam," said the old
detective to his companion, when they were both
comfortably seated. "I don't quite see how you
managed it."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's easy enough when you know how," returned
Detective Killett with a smile. "And now
that we are here by ourselves, tell me what's up."</p>

<p>"You received my telegram all right?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I happened to be at the office, and so received
it in less than a quarter of an hour after you
sent it."</p>

<p>"That's better than the telegraph people usually
do."</p>

<p>"You're right, Mark; but they're learning not to
fool much time with our office. They're beginning
to find out that it isn't healthy."</p>

<p>"I'm glad to hear it. And now tell me, my good
friend, can you devote a little time to me for a day
or so?"</p>

<p>"Most certainly. But let me ask again, what's
up? Your message, you know, gave me no sort of
idea."</p>

<p>"True. Well, I'll tell you. We've had a murder
in our place&mdash;a most cowardly affair."</p>

<p>"That sort of thing happens pretty often up your
way, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"Well, we do seem to have more than our fair
share of cowardly murders and kindred crimes; but
this was a peculiar case&mdash;a most unnecessary killing."</p>

<p>"The victim was an old woman&mdash;a Jewess or a
German, wasn't she?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Kept a low barroom or something of the sort?"</p>

<p>"You're right, the place was a regular dive, but
had been carried on with so much secrecy that even
the police never really knew what was going on
there."</p>

<p>"Hum, have you any idea who the murderer or
murderers were?"</p>

<p>"I know this much: they came up from New
York&mdash;probably that very evening, and it's more
than likely returned the same night."</p>

<p>"Hum, New York parties, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but I think one of them must have been
pretty well acquainted in our city, and particularly
well acquainted with the murdered woman and her
establishment."</p>

<p>"You have no idea who he is?"</p>

<p>"He is called Hen, and has a young lady friend,
with whom he is pretty intimate, somewhere on
Sixth Avenue, in this city. That's all I know."</p>

<p>Detective Killett became very thoughtful.</p>

<p>At length he asked:</p>

<p>"How did you gain this much information?"</p>

<p>Old Spicer informed him.</p>

<p>"Oho!" exclaimed Killett, when he had finished,
"that was the way of it, eh? Then your men are
as good as bagged."</p>

<p>"How's that?" asked Spicer, eagerly.</p>

<p>"It's plain enough," was the answer. "You will
know Barney Hawks and Jake Klinkhammer whenever
and wherever you see them again, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Most decidedly, yes."</p>

<p>"Well, trust me, they will be making for this
city as soon as they've had an interview with that
Sadie Seaton. If you had gone to her, most likely
she would have lied to you; but she will tell these
villains just where Hen and his pal can be found.
We must, therefore, be on hand to receive them
when they arrive, and follow them wherever they
go till they lead us to our game, then, at the right
moment, we can bag the whole lot."</p>

<p>"Killett, you're a trump. I salute you!"</p>

<p>"Thanks, Mark. Such a compliment, from the
very prince of detectives, is particularly agreeable."</p>

<p>"You are worthy of the best compliment I can
pay, old friend. And now let's see: when does the
next train arrive?"</p>

<p>"Seven o'clock."</p>

<p>"Seven o'clock; they won't be on that."</p>

<p>"Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"Yes, quite so."</p>

<p>"Couldn't they have caught it?"</p>

<p>"Hardly."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"They would be detained some time with the
girl; and then, I fancy, they would be too shrewd
to take the train at New Haven."</p>

<p>"You're right, by Jove! Now what station
would they be most likely to get on at?"</p>

<p>"Either Woodmont or Milford; and as Woodmont
is a small place, and Milford quite a town, for obvious
reasons, I think they would go to the latter."</p>

<p>"Doubtless. Well, the next train leaves Milford
at 5.31, and arrives here at eight o'clock. Can they
have caught that?"</p>

<p>"Quite easily, I should say."</p>

<p>"Then we must have a sharp eye on the passengers
arriving by that train."</p>

<p>"But it is usually quite a long train, I believe;
and there are so many ways of getting out of the
Grand Central Depot&mdash;can we two manage the
thing alone?"</p>

<p>"I was just thinking of that, and I fancy we had
better have a little help. Do you remember Stark?"</p>

<p>"What&mdash;your old friend, Silas?"</p>

<p>"The same."</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember him well."</p>

<p>"Glad to hear it. You've no objection to my
calling him in?"</p>

<p>"None in the world. I shall be glad to have his
assistance."</p>

<p>"Then I'll send for him and Rouse. It so happens
they are in this neighborhood. Excuse me a
moment, and I'll telephone for them," and Detective
Killett left the room.</p>

<p>In a few moments he returned, and ten minutes
later Silas Stark and Reuben Rouse entered the
apartment.</p>

<p>Old Spicer minutely described Barney and Jake,
and both Silas and Reub thought they should recognize
them without the slightest trouble.</p>

<p>But Killett suddenly started a possible difficulty.</p>

<p>"These fellows are cunning rascals," he said;
"ten to one, when they land, they will be disguised."</p>

<p>"Right, by Jove!" exclaimed Old Spicer; "and if
they are as cunning as I think they are, they'll separate,
and reach their objective point from different
directions."</p>

<p>"Just so; and we must be prepared for any such
little game." Then, turning to the man he called his
right bower:</p>

<p>"Silas," he asked, "do you think you can penetrate
any disguise they may assume?"</p>

<p>"I fancy I shall know that Hawks, sir," was the
answer; "for, if I am not greatly mistaken, I have
seen the villain more than once already."</p>

<p>"And you, Rouse?"</p>

<p>"I reckon I can get on to the Jew, sir," replied
Reub.</p>

<p>"How'll you know him?"</p>

<p>"I shall know him by his nose, sir. He can't disguise
that, I take it."</p>

<p>Both Killett and Old Spicer laughed.</p>

<p>"A good ear-mark to go by," observed the latter.</p>

<p>"Ear-mark, eh? I shouldn't have thought to call
it by that name."</p>

<p>"It's about time for the seven o'clock train to arrive,"
said Killett, suddenly; "any use in going
over, think?"</p>

<p>"It will do no harm," returned Old Spicer; "but,
as I said before, it's hardly possible for them to
have caught it."</p>

<p>"No matter, let's go across any way," and the
quartet of detectives went over to the depot, and
planting themselves at different points, waited for
the train.</p>

<p>Very soon it came rolling in, and every passenger
was brought under the eye of one or the other of
the quartet.</p>

<p>At length the last had gone, and neither Barney
nor Jake had been seen.</p>

<p>They went back to the hotel and held another
consultation, which lasted for nearly an hour.</p>

<p>Again, as the pointers of Old Spicer's faithful
watch indicated that the hour of eight had almost
arrived, they crossed over to the depot and stationed
themselves as before.</p>

<p>Presently the train came in, and the passengers
began to crowd their way out of it and hasten toward
the street.</p>

<p>Soon Barney and Jake made their appearance,
disguised in the overcoats and hats "borrowed"
from the rack in the hall of the murdered Marsden's
house.</p>

<p>Old Spicer, who, during the past hour had carefully
disguised himself, and Silas Stark caught sight
of them at the same time.</p>

<p>The precious pair walked for some distance toward
the exit, conversing together in low and hurried
tones. Then they separated, Jake pressing on
ahead, and ascending to the elevated railway station,
while Barney passed out on to Forty-second
Street, and hurried toward Sixth Avenue.</p>

<p>Old Spicer made a signal to Killett, and the two
followed Barney.</p>

<p>Seeing this, Silas Stark motioned to Reub, and together
they hurried up-stairs after Jake.</p>

<p>Barney kept on toward Sixth Avenue, little suspecting
who was behind him.</p>

<p>He ascended to the elevated station at the corner
of the avenue and Forty-second Street, on the down-town
side, and was the first to board a train that
stopped just as he reached the platform.</p>

<p>A moment later the two famous detectives were
in the same car.</p>

<p>Barney paid no attention to the other passengers,
but turning his head, gazed steadfastly out of the
window.</p>

<p>At the station nearest to Christopher Street, he
got off, and hurrying down that street, turned into
Hudson. Then he began looking for No. 515, the
two detectives still close behind him.</p>

<p>At length he found the saloon, and after one
hasty glance, entered it.</p>

<p>Old Spicer and Killett approached the door. A
hard-looking bummer was loafing on the outside,
waiting for some one, or any one, out of whom he
might beat a drink.</p>

<p>"Who runs this establishment?" asked Killett.</p>

<p>"Jimmie Taylor," was the prompt reply.</p>

<p>"Ah! Jimmie Taylor, eh? Guess this will do for
us. Let's go in and have something."</p>

<p>"Thank ye, sir, I don't mind if I do," exclaimed
the bum, with alacrity.</p>

<p>"I wasn't speaking to you, sir," laughed Killett.
"However, come along; I don't mind planting another
nail in your coffin."</p>

<p>They entered, and discovered Barney at a table
in a corner, with a glass of whisky before him.</p>

<p>"Barkeeper," said Killett, "give this fellow what
he calls for, and bring us two sours to the table over
there;" and they took seats at some little distance
from Barney, but within earshot, provided any one
should speak to him.</p>

<p>The "bum" ordered a whisky straight, and when
he had been supplied with his favorite fluid, the
barkeeper built the sours and took them to his waiting
customers.</p>

<p>While he was receiving his pay, Barney made a
slight motion to him with his hand, which Old
Spicer caught, and at once prepared to see what
came of it.</p>

<p>The barkeeper turned and went over to the corner.</p>

<p>"Listen with all your ears now," said Old Spicer,
in a low and rapid whisper, "for the time has
come for us to learn something."</p>

<p>"I'm ready to drink it all in," replied his companion,
quietly.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h2>

<p class="center">JIM TAYLOR MAKES HIS APPEARANCE.</p>


<p>"Where's the proprietor?" asked Barney, as the
barkeeper approached his table.</p>

<p>"Don't know," was the reply; "hasn't been
around much for the past two or three days. Him
and his chum are having a pretty loud time of it, I
reckon."</p>

<p>"His chum? Do you mean Hen Chamberlain?"</p>

<p>"No, that ain't his name."</p>

<p>"No, of course not. What am I thinking of?
Frank Clark's more like it, eh?"</p>

<p>"That's the man."</p>

<p>"So they're off together?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so; they're together most of the time&mdash;thicker
than thieves, by Jove!"</p>

<p>"Damon and Pythias over again, eh?"</p>

<p>"I should say so."</p>

<p>"Taylor hasn't been in this morning?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Wasn't he here yesterday?"</p>

<p>"Only for a little while. Do you want to see
him?"</p>

<p>"I jist do that."</p>

<p>"Anything up?"</p>

<p>"Nothing very alarming. I heard he wanted to
sell this place. Do you know anything about it?"</p>

<p>"I hadn't heard that he wanted to sell it, but I
reckon he'd be glad enough to."</p>

<p>"'Tain't paying very well, I reckon?"</p>

<p>"Not first-rate; but if a man had a little capital,
and would make it a little more attractive, it could
be made to pay first-class."</p>

<p>"That's exactly what I think. I've got an idea
or two that I believe can be made to work here, and
pay big."</p>

<p>"Shall you be alone?"</p>

<p>"No; I shall have a partner. Expect him here
every moment."</p>

<p>"If you should make a trade you will want a barkeeper,
I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Certainly; and if Taylor speaks well of you,
there's no doubt but you can stay on if you want
to."</p>

<p>"He ought to speak well of me. He trusts me
with everything. You can see for yourself, he goes
off for days together, and leaves me to run the
establishment alone."</p>

<p>"I see, and I'm sure you're jist the man we shall
want."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir. Will you take something more,
sir?"</p>

<p>"Don't mind if I do."</p>

<p>The barkeeper went behind the bar, placed a bottle
and two glasses on a salver, and returned.</p>

<p>"This is on me," he said, seating himself opposite
Barney, who, after he had taken a drink, asked:</p>

<p>"This Frank Clark, do you know him?"</p>

<p>"Only as I have seen him here," was the reply.</p>

<p>"He's from down East, isn't he?" asked Barney.</p>

<p>"Yes, Connecticut way, I believe," returned the
other.</p>

<p>"Where does he board?"</p>

<p>"Don't think he has any regular boarding-place."</p>

<p>"He has a room, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but I don't know just where it is."</p>

<p>"It's in this neighborhood?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but I can't give you the street and number."</p>

<p>"He visits a girl on Sixth Avenue pretty often, I
hear."</p>

<p>"Yes, and a thundering pretty girl she is, too."</p>

<p>"What's her name?"</p>

<p>"Cora Bell."</p>

<p>"To be sure, I remember now. I suppose you
don't know her number?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I've heard it often enough to know it."</p>

<p>"What is it, then?"</p>

<p>"Twenty-two. But I say, are you going to try to
get her away from Clark?"</p>

<p>"Hardly, seeing I'm not much of a lady's man.
But the fact is, my young friend, if we're going
to do anything about this matter, we must do
it to-day; and if Taylor don't show up pretty soon
after my partner arrives, we must try to find him,
and I thought, seeing he was with Clark so much,
that it might be well for us to pay a visit to Clark's
girl."</p>

<p>"You're right, sir, they do go there a good deal."</p>

<p>"Of course, and here's my man at last. Mr.
Klinkhammer, permit me to introduce you to Mr.
Taylor's representative; I have had quite a talk with
him while waiting for you, and have promised that
he shall keep his place, in case we succeed in buying
out the establishment."</p>

<p>Jake took the cue in an instant.</p>

<p>"Glad to see you, sir," he said. "Like your
looks, sir. Shall pe wery glad to 'ave you vid us."</p>

<p>Then seating himself, and coolly appropriating
the barkeeper's glass, and filling it from the bottle,
he asked, after taking a good swallow:</p>

<p>"Vhere vos Mesther Taylor?"</p>

<p>"That I don't know," answered the barkeeper.
"I have just been explaining to Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, your
friend here, how it is that I have seen very little of
him for the past few days."</p>

<p>"Has he been out uv town?" asked Jake, carelessly.</p>

<p>"Not that I know of," was the answer. "But he
might have gone to Boston or Halifax, and I be none
the wiser."</p>

<p>"I see, I see. He goes und comes schust when
he bleases, und leaves you here to run der shebang."</p>

<p>"Exactly so, sir."</p>

<p>"Vell, dot vos all right."</p>

<p>"It's all right, provided we find him," said
Barney.</p>

<p>"Dot vos schust vot I meant. Und if ve don't&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>At that moment a not bad-looking young man, of
some twenty-one or twenty-two years of age, with
the evident marks of recent dissipation upon him,
entered the saloon.</p>

<p>He cast a hasty glance about him, and ended with
an inquiring look directed toward the barkeeper,
who started hastily to his feet.</p>

<p>"These gentlemen are anxious to see you on private
business," he explained. Then turning to the
two burglars: "This is Mr. Taylor," he said.</p>

<p>"You want to see me, do you?" asked Taylor,
coming up to the table and looking them squarely
in the face.</p>

<p>"That's exactly what we want, sir," answered
Barney, quietly.</p>

<p>"What's your business?"</p>

<p>"You own this establishment?"</p>

<p>"I own the lease and the business."</p>

<p>"Got a license, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"We want to buy the business."</p>

<p>"The devil you do!"</p>

<p>This was said with a good deal of energy, and
with some show of interest.</p>

<p>"That's what we want," said Barney.</p>

<p>"You vill sell, eh?" put in Jake.</p>

<p>"I shall be blamed glad to sell, provided I don't
have to give the place away."</p>

<p>"All right, we're the men to talk with you," said
Barney, confidently.</p>

<p>"Come with me, then," and he led the way into a
back room.</p>

<p>"Can you get near enough to them to hear what
is said?" asked Old Spicer, hurriedly.</p>

<p>"I think so," answered Killett, with a confident
nod.</p>

<p>"Then suppose I go to Miss Bell's and see what I
can make out of her?"</p>

<p>"The very thing!"</p>

<p>"I suppose Stark and Rouse are somewhere outside?"</p>

<p>"Without doubt."</p>

<p>"They'd better stick to you, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, for the present, I think."</p>

<p>"Where'll I meet you?"</p>

<p>Killett reflected.</p>

<p>"If you don't find some one in front of Miss Bell's
when you leave her," he presently said, "why, come
back here. One of us will be around waiting for
you."</p>

<p>"All right. And now I'm off," and, starting up
from the table, Old Spicer sauntered from the
saloon.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a></h2>

<p class="center">THE TRUE STORY OF THE MURDER.</p>


<p>Detective Killett also arose from the table, and,
approaching the bar, asked:</p>

<p>"Have you got a quiet little room handy, where I
can drink one or two whisky punches by myself,
and do a little writing?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;yes, there's a room in there that's vacant,"
answered the barkeeper; "but we haven't any
writing materials."</p>

<p>"Don't let that trouble you," returned Killett,
cheerfully, as he exhibited a pad of paper and a
stylographic pen; "you see I carry my tools with
me."</p>

<p>"All right then. I'll show you to the room, and
bring you a punch as soon as I can get it ready."</p>

<p>"Thanks, my friend," and Killett followed him
through the door by which Taylor and the couple
with him had disappeared a few moments before.</p>

<p>On passing the door the detective found himself
in a narrow hall, on one side of which was a black
walnut partition, reaching about half way to the
ceiling.</p>

<p>In this partition were two doors, leading to two
small rooms, fitted up for card-playing.</p>

<p>The first of these rooms was now occupied by
Taylor's party.</p>

<p>Killett was shown into the other.</p>

<p>He was in an agony of apprehension for fear those
in the next room would hear the door open, or
catch the sound of the barkeeper's voice.</p>

<p>But nothing of the kind happened. The door was
opened noiselessly, and the barkeeper merely said:</p>

<p>"Here you are, sir. I'll bring the punch presently."</p>

<p>Killett nodded, and the dispenser of liquid refreshments
went away.</p>

<p>The detective now seated himself close to the partition
between the two rooms, took out his pad of
paper and his pen, and prepared to listen with all
his ears to what might be going on in the other
apartment.</p>

<p>The first words that reached him were spoken by
Taylor.</p>

<p>"So you ain't so blamed anxious to buy after all?"
he was saying.</p>

<p>"That depends upon circumstances," returned
Barney, quickly.</p>

<p>"What circumstances?"</p>

<p>Barney seemed to hesitate for a moment, then he
abruptly asked:</p>

<p>"When did you see Hen Chamberlain last?"</p>

<p>"Who?" demanded Taylor, in a tone of surprise.</p>

<p>"Oh, pshaw! You know well enough who I
mean. Call him Frank Clark, if you like."</p>

<p>Taylor started slightly, but presently said, calmly
enough:</p>

<p>"You know Clark, do you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, old fellow, we know him from 'way back,"
was the reply, "but up our way he is Henry Burton
Chamberlain."</p>

<p>"Hum," muttered Taylor; "I suppose that <i>is</i> his
name."</p>

<p>"Of course it is; and it seems to me that there
need be no more mystery among friends."</p>

<p>"Ah! but remember, gentlemen, you are both
strangers to me."</p>

<p>"That's true enough; but we are not strangers to
Hen Chamberlain."</p>

<p>"Let's see&mdash;did you mention your names?"</p>

<p>"I don't know that we have to you. But that's
an omission readily corrected. Mine is Barney
Hawks, and this is my pal, Jake Klinkhammer."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, I have heard Chamberlain speak of you.
If I remember rightly, you have been in two or three
little affairs with him?"</p>

<p>"I should say we had! and a good many more
than two or three."</p>

<p>"You are pretty good friends of his, then?"</p>

<p>"We have proved that to his satisfaction a good
many times, I believe."</p>

<p>"Well, that's all right. And now why can't we
talk business?"</p>

<p>"Why, the fact is, Mr. Taylor, before we go any
further in this matter, we would like to see Hen."</p>

<p>"What do you expect to gain by seeing him?"</p>

<p>"Something in the way of funds, if you must
know."</p>

<p>"Ha, ha! I'm afraid you'll find there isn't much
in that mine worth working."</p>

<p>"There ought to be, considering the rich vein you
and he opened the other night."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" demanded Taylor, now
fairly startled.</p>

<p>"Oh, come, my boy," said Barney, quietly, "we
know all about it, and can name pretty nearly the
sum you brought away with you."</p>

<p>"You can?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Where did you get your information, in the
fiend's name?"</p>

<p>"We have seen Sadie Seaton."</p>

<p>"The deuce you have! Are you detectives?"</p>

<p>"Detectives? Thunder! What are you talking
about? I told you a moment ago who we were."</p>

<p>"I know, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you don't believe us. Why, man, we had
planned to do that little job ourselves. You only
got in ahead of us, that's all."</p>

<p>"Then what's the matter&mdash;what do you want of
us?"</p>

<p>"Well, the fact is, there was a little treachery
practiced on us by Mr. Henry Chamberlain. It was
our job; he knew it, and now we claim our fair
share of the spoils."</p>

<p>Taylor lay back and laughed a bitter, ironical
laugh.</p>

<p>"What the deuce is the matter with you?" demanded
Barney, almost savagely.</p>

<p>"May I ask you one question?" inquired Taylor
politely.</p>

<p>"Of course; what is it?"</p>

<p>"How much do you think we got out of that little
job?"</p>

<p>"Close on to twenty thousand dollars."</p>

<p>Again came the bitter, ironical laugh.</p>

<p>"Twenty thousand dollars, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, close on to that."</p>

<p>"You feel pretty sure of it?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I tell you Sadie was pretty well posted.
She knew what the old woman had by her that
night; and the place shows for itself that you went
through it thoroughly."</p>

<p>"Well, how much will you give me for my share
of the boodle?"</p>

<p>"Mind, Taylor, we claim one half of all you
brought away as ours by rights."</p>

<p>"Well, well, whatever you claim, what will you
give me for all I brought away?"</p>

<p>"Four thousand dollars."</p>

<p>"Done! Ha! ha! that's the best bargain I ever
made."</p>

<p>"In the devil's name, what's the matter with
you, man? Are you trying to come some game
over us?"</p>

<p>"Petter not!" growled Jake, warningly.</p>

<p>"There's been a pretty game played by some
one," said Taylor, gloomily; "but it's been a bitter
one for me. You think I brought away ten thousand
dollars, don't you?"</p>

<p>"About that, yes."</p>

<p>"Well, the exact sum I got out of the job was&mdash;twenty-three
dollars and seventy-one cents."</p>

<p>"Twenty-three dollars and seventy-one cents!
Young man, what are you giving us?"</p>

<p>"I am giving it to you straight. That's all I
got."</p>

<p>"And Chamberlain, how much did he get?"</p>

<p>"Twenty-two dollars."</p>

<p>"He made you believe that, did he?"</p>

<p>"That's all he had. We divided in the cars, coming
home."</p>

<p>"Hum, there's something I don't understand here
somewhere. Either Chamberlain has cheated you,
or&mdash;&mdash; But suppose you tell us about the affair
from the time you left this city."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't mind. We left the Grand Central
Depot at 6:45 Monday night, and arrived in New
Haven at 9:30.</p>

<p>"We had some drinks in a saloon near the depot,
and about ten o'clock went to the Ernst place on
Spruce Street.</p>

<p>"Passing through a narrow alley alongside of her
blamed old rookery, we looked through the rear
window and saw a certain young woman talking to
Mrs. Ernst."</p>

<p>"Ah! did you know that young woman?"</p>

<p>"I did not."</p>

<p>"But Chamberlain did, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And he told you who she was?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, was it Sadie?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it was Sadie."</p>

<p>"And you waited till she came out?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Did you speak to her?"</p>

<p>"Chamberlain spoke to her."</p>

<p>"What did he say?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. He led her a little one side and
they had considerable jaw together, then she hurried
away&mdash;crying, I thought."</p>

<p>"Humph; and what happened then?"</p>

<p>"Why, as soon as Sadie had left the basement,
the old woman locked the front door, and then came
round and fastened the back door with an iron
bar."</p>

<p>"About what time was that?"</p>

<p>"It wanted just a quarter to ten."</p>

<p>"What did you do then?"</p>

<p>"We went softly down the area steps from the
yard, and Chamberlain rapped on the door."</p>

<p>"Did it fetch the old gal at once?"</p>

<p>"Almost instantly. 'Who's there?' she asked.</p>

<p>"'It vos me, ma'am,' answered Chamberlain, disguising
his voice, and talking with a German accent.
'Open, I got a letter for you.'</p>

<p>"'Who's it from?' asked the old woman.</p>

<p>"'August Tepley,' was the reply, 'and it's of
special importance, I can tell you.'"</p>

<p>"I know that August Tepley," interrupted Barney,
at this point. "He's a relative of the old woman,
and came over from Bavaria awhile ago."</p>

<p>"Und I know him too," grunted Jake. "But go
on, Mr. Taylor."</p>

<p>"Well," continued Taylor, "Mrs. Ernst took off
the heavy bar and we stepped inside, I closing and
locking the door myself.</p>

<p>"'Let's go into the saloon,' suggested Hen.
'You've got a light there, haven't you, old gal?'</p>

<p>"'Yes,' she said, and led the way to the bar-room.</p>

<p>"As soon as we got there Chamberlain called for
drinks, and we soon managed to draw the old
woman into conversation.</p>

<p>"She asked Hen if he had ever been in her place
before.</p>

<p>"'Lord, yes!" he replied, 'more than a thousand
times.' Then with a laugh, 'why, Mrs. Ernst, I
have known you for years.'</p>

<p>"After that she appeared to recognize him, and
really seemed glad to see him.</p>

<p>"Shortly after eleven o'clock the old woman
asked for the letter we had brought. Chamberlain
took an envelope from his pocket, and just as she
started to come around the corner of the bar, he
seized her by the neck and hurled her to the floor,
while I threw a cloak over her head and face, and
assisted him to bind and gag her.</p>

<p>"Hen then pressed a handkerchief, saturated
with chloroform, over her mouth and nostrils, and
gripped her throat until she was unconscious.</p>

<p>"We used handkerchiefs in binding her. Chamberlain
tied her hands together, while I made her
feet fast. We then picked her up, and laid her on
the lounge in front of the bar."</p>

<p>"Your story is getting interesting," said Barney.
"Well, after you'd got the old gal made fast, I suppose
you began your search for the boodle?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I lost no time in opening the till, and took
out four dollars in change&mdash;all the money in it."</p>

<p>"Not a big haul that," observed Barney.</p>

<p>"That's what we thought.</p>

<p>"'Must be more money somewhere,' said Chamberlain,
and he began tearing up the carpets and
ripping open the mattresses in the room, looking for
it.</p>

<p>"'Let's try the other rooms,' he said, presently;
and we took off our shoes, turned out the gas, lit a
candle, and went into the old woman's bedroom.</p>

<p>"Chamberlain had bought a chisel in this city,
for forty cents, and I tried to pry open a bureau
drawer, that was tightly locked, with it.</p>

<p>"'You're making too much noise,' said Chamberlain;
'let me try it;' and he opened the drawer in a
jiffy."</p>

<p>"Vos dere anyting in dot drawer?" asked Jake,
curiously.</p>

<p>"Yes, by Jove! $41.10; and Chamberlain pocketed
it quicker than you could say Jack Robinson."</p>

<p>"He did, eh? Vell, dot vos wrong."</p>

<p>"But he divided afterward, I suppose?" said
Barney.</p>

<p>"Yes, on the cars, as I told you."</p>

<p>"All right; go on."</p>

<p>"Well, while we were ransacking closets and
drawers, and looking under the carpets and between
the bedding, the old woman came to, and yelled
murder.</p>

<p>"Chamberlain ran into the room where she lay,
and, seizing her by the throat, dashed her head
against the woodwork of the lounge until she again
became unconscious. I then wrapped a sheet around
her neck, while Chamberlain put a fresh gag in her
mouth.</p>

<p>"We then went on with our search, but not finding
any more money about the rooms, Hen returned
to the lounge and began searching the woman's
clothes.</p>

<p>"As he took the sheet from her face he turned
coolly around to me and said:</p>

<p>"'Jim, she's dead.'</p>

<p>"'So she is,' I answered, looking at her face."</p>

<p>"Well, did you find anything of value on the old
woman?" asked Barney. "I believe she used to
carry a pretty fat roll of bills in her bosom."</p>

<p>"No; we found nothing in her bosom or in her
pockets."</p>

<p>"Vell, vhat did you do then?" asked Jake.</p>

<p>"Chamberlain sat down on the sofa at the feet of
the corpse and put on his shoes. I leaned against
the bar and drew on my gaiters. Then we helped
ourselves to several drinks of the old woman's
whisky, and filled our pockets with her cigars."</p>

<p>"Dot vos right; dot vos vhat I should hav' done.
Then you vent off, eh?"</p>

<p>"Not at once. First Chamberlain walked over to
the sofa, and took a closer look at the face of the
dead woman, and looking up, he said:</p>

<p>"'She's dead, sure, Jim,' and so he took the handkerchief
out of her mouth."</p>

<p>"He's a pretty cool hand," observed Barney.</p>

<p>"He's just that, as his next move shows."</p>

<p>"And what was his next move?"</p>

<p>"He took his revolver from his pocket, and coolly
cocking it, said:</p>

<p>"Somebody may have heard us, Jim. Take off
the bar and draw your gun. We may have to kill
somebody else."</p>

<p>"Und, so 'elp me gracious! he vould hav' done it,
too, if you had met somepody."</p>

<p>"You bet your life he would. Well, with cocked
revolvers in our hands, we walked into the street,
and made our way toward the railway station. In
a saloon near the depot we had a couple of glasses
of beer, and bought a pint of whisky. Then we
took the 11.50 train for New York, and, as I told
you, in the cars we divided the old woman's
money."</p>

<p>"And got less than twenty-five dollars apiece?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Where did you leave the cars?"</p>

<p>"We got off the train on the other side of the
bridge, and rode to Fourteenth Street and Third
Avenue on the Third Avenue Elevated Road."</p>

<p>"Then you ought to have tried to establish an
<i>alibi</i>."</p>

<p>"That's just what we did."</p>

<p>"How did you manage it?"</p>

<p>"'Let's go where we're known,' said Chamberlain,
so in case of trouble we'll have an <i>alibi</i>.'</p>

<p>"'All right,' said I. 'Where shall we go?'</p>

<p>"'Come with me,' he replied; and we went to
Ryan &amp; Coopers' saloon, on the north-west corner
of Hudson and West Twelfth Streets, and had several
drinks.</p>

<p>"Chamberlain smiled as we came out.</p>

<p>"'Cooper can't forget us,' he said, 'for we treated
him twice.'</p>

<p>"'That's so,' I assented; 'and I shouldn't wonder
if that was a wise dodge.'"</p>

<p>"And what did you do then?"</p>

<p>"We separated."</p>

<p>"You've seen him since, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, once or twice; but I don't know where
he is now."</p>

<p>"You'd better find him, then, and at once."</p>

<p>"Why so?"</p>

<p>"Old Spicer, the sharpest detective on top of this
earth, is on his track and yours."</p>

<p>"The deuce he is!"</p>

<p>"I'm giving it to you straight, young man."</p>

<p>"What in thunder shall I do?"</p>

<p>"Warn Chamberlain in some way, and then dig&mdash;that's
my advice."</p>

<p>Killett waited to hear no more; but, quietly slipping
out of the little room, he went to the bar, paid
for his punch and left the saloon.</p>

<p>Outside he found Stark and Rouse, and after a few
hurried words with them and a rapid glance around,
he hastened away.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</a></h2>

<p class="center">OLD SPICER INTERVIEWS CORA BELL.</p>


<p>Old Spicer had no difficulty in finding No. 22
Sixth Avenue; and having gained an entrance to
the house, he rapidly ascended to the third floor.</p>

<p>One glance satisfied him as to which were Miss
Bell's apartments, and he knocked at the door of
her reception-room.</p>

<p>After a moment's waiting, he heard light footsteps
approaching from an inner room; then the door
opened, and a young woman about twenty-two
years of age, with a fine form and a very pretty
face, stood before him.</p>

<p>She seemed struck with amazement as her eyes
rested on the tall, spare form and somewhat aged
face of the famous detective. Then his eyes&mdash;those
wonderful eyes which had searched so many hearts
and made so many criminals tremble&mdash;troubled
her.</p>

<p>"Who&mdash;who did you wish to see?" she at length
managed to stammer forth.</p>

<p>"Your own sweet self, and no one else," returned
Old Spicer, with his most winning smile and in his
most pleasing tones.</p>

<p>"Do you know me, sir?" asked the young woman,
in surprise. "I don't remember ever having seen
you before."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; I know you very well, my dear. There
are young ladies and young ladies, but there <i>can</i> be
but one Cora Bell."</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, I fear you are a flatterer," exclaimed the
pleased girl. "Will you walk in?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps it will be as well," and he entered the
young lady's reception-room.</p>

<p>"Take a seat, sir," said Cora, sweetly.</p>

<p>"Thank you, my dear," and Old Spicer seated
himself in an easy-chair.</p>

<p>Cora was about to sit down at some little distance
from him, but pointing to another chair much
nearer, he said:</p>

<p>"That is the place for you," and smiling pleasantly,
she took it.</p>

<p>For a moment neither spoke. At length Cora,
whose curiosity was greatly excited, asked:</p>

<p>"Where have I seen you before, sir?"</p>

<p>"Don't you remember, my dear?" returned the
old man.</p>

<p>"No, I confess that I do not."</p>

<p>"Ah! how humiliating that is! To think that
while I have had you so constantly in my mind, you
have not given to me even so much as a passing
thought."</p>

<p>"Good gracious! how could I, when I don't know
you from Adam?"</p>

<p>"There! now that's an unkind thrust at my age.
True, I <i>am</i> somewhat older than yourself, but if you
only have a little patience, and don't get drawn
into any serious scrapes&mdash;like murder, for instance&mdash;you
may see the time when you will be as old-looking
as I am."</p>

<p>Cora's face suddenly blanched, and she stared
helplessly at her visitor. But he looked so innocent
and unconscious that she at length mustered courage
to ask:</p>

<p>"Why do you take the trouble to allude to serious
scrapes? Do you think I am likely to be drawn into
anything of the kind?"</p>

<p>"You lead a somewhat irregular life, do you not,
my dear?" said Old Spicer.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?" asked the girl,
quickly.</p>

<p>"You go to theaters, balls and parties, eat late
suppers, and see a good deal of gentlemen's society,
don't you?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"The gentlemen of your acquaintance are not all
saints, I take it?"</p>

<p>Cora gave a somewhat boisterous laugh.</p>

<p>"Anything but that," she said.</p>

<p>"Well, there it is. Haven't you ever heard the
old saw, that you can't handle pitch without being
defiled?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have heard something like that."</p>

<p>"Well, probably you've never thought much about
it, but I assure you it's true&mdash;both of pitch and persons."</p>

<p>"I hope you haven't come to preach me a sermon."</p>

<p>"Do I look like a preacher?"</p>

<p>"I hadn't thought much about it before, but I'm
blessed if you don't. But then, you might be anything
else that's grave and terrible. A judge, or a&mdash;a&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, a what?"</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind. Who are you, any way?"</p>

<p>"Let me ask you a question first."</p>

<p>"Drive on. What is it?"</p>

<p>Old Spicer took a pocket-handkerchief from his
pocket and quietly spread it on her lap.</p>

<p>"Did you ever see that before?" he asked.</p>

<p>Cora Bell's face instantly became ashy pale, and
had she not clutched at the table by her side, she
must have sunk to the floor.</p>

<p>"Ah! I see you know it," said the detective, in his
quiet, matter-of-fact tones.</p>

<p>"I knew it! I knew it!" she murmured, excitedly.</p>

<p>"I saw you did," he repeated.</p>

<p>But without paying any attention to his remark,
she went on:</p>

<p>"I knew I was right the moment I thought of it.
You're a detective."</p>

<p>Then, with a reckless&mdash;an almost despairing air:</p>

<p>"Well, what do you want of me, any way?"</p>

<p>Old Spicer regarded her in silence for a moment;
and then, as if communing with himself, he murmured
aloud:</p>

<p>"So pretty! and so young! Not above twenty-one
or twenty-two, I should say. Sad, very sad. Enough
to make a strong man weep."</p>

<p>"Oh! what is it&mdash;what is it that's so horrible?"
gasped Cora, in an agony of terror.</p>

<p>"Ah! my poor girl, your own heart&mdash;your own
conscience must tell you."</p>

<p>Cora started to her feet.</p>

<p>"Hear me, sir!" she cried. "I know nothing
at all about it. I had nothing whatever to do with
it."</p>

<p>Old Spicer quietly picked up the handkerchief,
which had fallen to the floor, and holding it in one
hand, while he pointed to it significantly with the
other, said:</p>

<p>"That tells a different story, my dear."</p>

<p>"I know what you mean&mdash;yes, that's my handkerchief,"
she said, "but he took it that evening
without my permission&mdash;that, and at least half a
dozen others that I bought for him that day."</p>

<p>"And you didn't know what he was going to do
with them?"</p>

<p>"Of course not. I never dreamed of what was
going to happen."</p>

<p>"He said nothing at all to you about it then?"</p>

<p>"Yes, on the Saturday before he told me that he
knew an old woman in the place he came from who
had between thirty and forty thousand dollars in
her house, and that he was going to get it."</p>

<p>"Ah, indeed? And what did you say to that,
my dear?"</p>

<p>"I told him that he had much better go to
work."</p>

<p>"But he wouldn't take your good advice?"</p>

<p>"No, he just laughed, and said he didn't propose
to work all summer."</p>

<p>"Did you believe he would go up to New Haven
and rob the old woman?"</p>

<p>"No, to tell the truth, I didn't believe he had the
nerve to do it."</p>

<p>"He has, I believe, a good deal of what is called
brute courage."</p>

<p>"Yes, but I hadn't discovered it before."</p>

<p>"How long have you known Chamberlain?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell that exactly."</p>

<p>"How long have you been intimate with him?"</p>

<p>"Some seven or eight months."</p>

<p>"Did you know, Monday night, that he had gone
to commit this robbery?"</p>

<p>"No, I only knew that he had gone out of town."</p>

<p>"Did he tell you about it when he came back?"</p>

<p>"The way of it was this: Tuesday evening I was
reading an account of the murder, when Chamberlain
came in. Then the truth flashed upon me at
once. I accused him of killing the old woman, and
he admitted it."</p>

<p>"He had plenty of money then, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he had a big roll of bills in his pocket."</p>

<p>"No doubt he made you a handsome present?"</p>

<p>"There you're off, mister. Now, what do you
really think he gave me?"</p>

<p>"At least one hundred dollars&mdash;perhaps two hundred."</p>

<p>"The mean wretch only gave me a paltry five
dollar bill! What do you think of that?"</p>

<p>"If he got the big stake he is credited with having
carried off, you have fixed the right name on
him&mdash;he's a mean wretch."</p>

<p>"Big stake! my word for it, it was a big stake.
He got all he went for, you can bet high on that."</p>

<p>"No idea what he has done with it, I suppose?"
This was said carelessly.</p>

<p>"I have something of an idea," was the reply;
"but I don't know for a dead certainty."</p>

<p>"Well, what's your idea?"</p>

<p>"He's got a secret friend somewhere here in town,
but who that friend is I don't know, or whether it's
male or female I don't know. All I can say is, find
that friend and you'll find Margaret Ernst's money!"</p>

<p>"You think, then, he's placed the plunder in the
hands of this friend to keep for him?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure of it."</p>

<p>A silence of some moments' duration followed.</p>

<p>At length the old detective turned to Cora and
abruptly asked:</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear of such a person as Old
Spicer?"</p>

<p>The girl started.</p>

<p>"Good Lord! yes, sir!" she exclaimed. "I&mdash;I
hope you are not he?"</p>

<p>"Fortunately for you, my dear child, I am he,"
was the grave reply. "Now are you willing to take
some good advice from me?"</p>

<p>"I'll do anything in the world you tell me."</p>

<p>"In the first place, then, if Chamberlain should
visit you again, which I hardly think he will do, by
the way, you are not to mention my being here."</p>

<p>"I will not&mdash;I swear it."</p>

<p>The old man raised his finger impressively.</p>

<p>"That's enough! I believe you," he said.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you do."</p>

<p>"In the second place, then, if any other detective
comes here it will not be necessary for you to tell
him all you have told me."</p>

<p>"I won't tell him anything at all, if you say
so."</p>

<p>"Well, my dear, manage that the best you can."</p>

<p>"I think I can manage to hold my tongue."</p>

<p>"I hope so, my dear. By the way, are you acquainted
with any members of the detective force?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; I know one or two."</p>

<p>"Who are they?"</p>

<p>"Sergeant Cosgrove, for one."</p>

<p>"And McGuire, perhaps?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I know who he is."</p>

<p>"Well, if they, or either of them, make you a
call, you needn't volunteer any information, you understand."</p>

<p>"I understand. And&mdash;and if I do just as you tell
me, will you get me out of this awful scrape?"</p>

<p>"You have told me the worst&mdash;so far as you are
concerned?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I have, sir."</p>

<p>"Then I emphatically promise to see you through
it."</p>

<p>"Oh! thank you, sir."</p>

<p>"You're heartily welcome to all I can do for you,
my dear. And now I must leave you."</p>

<p>"I am sorry to have you go. When shall I see
you again?"</p>

<p>"That I cannot tell; but if you are threatened
with any danger, you may be sure I shall be on
hand."</p>

<p>"You are very good, sir."</p>

<p>"I am glad you think so."</p>

<p>Then Old Spicer arose and walked to the door.</p>

<p>As he turned the knob he looked back and said:</p>

<p>"By the way, where does Chamberlain make it
his home in the city?"</p>

<p>"He boards at 305 West Twelfth Street, and
rooms at Hudson and Morton streets," was the answer.</p>

<p>"Thank you, my dear. And now I must really
say good-day," and almost before the girl could repeat
the words of leave-taking the great detective
was gone.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.</a></h2>

<p class="center">JIM TAYLOR IS ARRESTED.</p>


<p>Old Spicer had hardly left the building when he
was joined by Killett.</p>

<p>"Thank fortune you are here!" he exclaimed in a
tone of relief. "There are three places that must be
shadowed instantly.</p>

<p>"What places are they?" asked his friend.</p>

<p>"The house I have just left, where Cora Bell
makes it her home, the boarding-house No. 305 West
Twelfth Street, and the building at the corner of
Hudson and Morton streets."</p>

<p>"What is the last?"</p>

<p>"The place where Chamberlain lodges."</p>

<p>"Good! Slip into this saloon, and I will see to
the matter at once."</p>

<p>Old Spicer went into the place designated, and
Killett hurried down the street.</p>

<p>In a few moments he returned, and after giving
Old Spicer an account of what had passed between
Taylor and the two burglars, he listened to the other's
account of his interview with Cora.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he exclaimed, when the old man had finished,
"there's just one thing for us to do to make
this the neatest and most perfect job ever handled
by detectives."</p>

<p>"Yes," nodded Old Spicer, "just one thing."</p>

<p>"And that is to discover Chamberlain's unknown
friend."</p>

<p>"Exactly."</p>

<p>"It can be done."</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"And we'll do it."</p>

<p>"To be sure we will."</p>

<p>"We must manage to drive Chamberlain to him,
I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps he will go without driving."</p>

<p>"Right! the moment he is out of funds he will go
to him for more."</p>

<p>"That's it."</p>

<p>"We ought to have Stark and Rouse looking after
him."</p>

<p>"Where are they now?"</p>

<p>"They are busy with Taylor and those precious
worthies, Hawks and Klinkhammer. By the way,
when had we better gather them in?"</p>

<p>"The moment they have led us to the scoundrel
who hired them to murder poor Charley Way."</p>

<p>"They have made an appointment with him to
meet them in the city to-day, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, then, we won't have long to wait."</p>

<p>"I hope not. Do your men know where to look
for you, Adam?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and, by Jove! here comes one of them
now."</p>

<p>"That's so; and it's Stark himself."</p>

<p>"Right. Well, Silas, what is it?"</p>

<p>"I have a suggestion to make, sir."</p>

<p>"Out with it, then."</p>

<p>"I would recommend taking Taylor before he
can see Chamberlain. They'll give us trouble if
they get together."</p>

<p>"You're right. And so far as I can see, there's
no reason why Taylor shouldn't be arrested at
once."</p>

<p>"It must be managed quietly, then," suggested
Old Spicer. "It mustn't be known that he's taken."</p>

<p>"Correct, old friend, I see the point. Is he still
in the saloon, Silas?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; but getting ready to leave."</p>

<p>"Well, send a policeman in uniform in there, and
have him tell Taylor that he is wanted at the excise
commissioners' office."</p>

<p>"All right sir; and what then?"</p>

<p>"Why, follow and arrest him; say somewhere
in the vicinity of Bond Street and Broadway."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir."</p>

<p>"Who's looking after the other scoundrels?"</p>

<p>"Quackenbush and Crowley."</p>

<p>"That's all right. And so, when Taylor is safe
under lock and key, I wish you'd be on the lookout
for Chamberlain," and Killett explained the situation.</p>

<p>"Oho! he has a secret friend, eh?" exclaimed
Stark, when he had finished. "I should like nothing
better than to hunt down that man."</p>

<p>"Why so?" asked Old Spicer, curiously.</p>

<p>"Because I believe it will turn out that he, whoever
he is, has encouraged this crime."</p>

<p>"Very likely," returned Spicer, in a musing tone.</p>

<p>"Well," exclaimed Killett, abruptly, "we shall
see by and by, and now be off with you, my good
friend," and Stark hurried away.</p>

<p>He soon fell in with a policeman.</p>

<p>"How are you, Tompkins?" he cried, slapping
the officer on the back. "Fine day."</p>

<p>"Hallo!" returned the man in blue, looking
round. "What the deuce&mdash;&mdash; Oh, is it you,
Stark?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it's me, old boy, and I have a little job for
you."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Walk along with me and I'll tell you."</p>

<p>The policeman fell into step with the detective,
and after a moment, said:</p>

<p>"Well, drive ahead."</p>

<p>"Know Jimmie Taylor's place, down Hudson
Street?" asked Stark.</p>

<p>"Know it? Well, I should say so!"</p>

<p>"All right; he's in there now. I want you to go
in and just say to him that he's wanted up at the
excise commissioners' office right away; and then,
in as unconcerned a manner as possible, come out."</p>

<p>"I understand. But, I say, Stark, what's the
row?"</p>

<p>"Nobody knows that yet, but you'll hear, I
fancy, before you're much older."</p>

<p>"All right. Here we are, and I'll do your little
job for you," and Tompkins entered the saloon.</p>

<p>Taylor was in earnest conversation with his barkeeper.</p>

<p>He looked up on hearing footsteps, and when he
saw the policeman, he started.</p>

<p>Tompkins appeared not to notice this, but walking
up to where he was standing, said, carelessly:</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Jemmie? What's the hitch
between you and the folks at the excise office?"</p>

<p>"Didn't know there was any," was the quick
reply. "I run this saloon on the square; and so
far as I know, there's no chance for any one to find
fault."</p>

<p>"You're all right, for anything I've ever seen to
the contrary, but something's up and you're wanted
at the excise office at once."</p>

<p>"At once, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, they want to question you, I suppose, and
if you'll take my advice, you'll get around there
with the least possible delay."</p>

<p>"I'll go this very minute. Jerry, give Mr. Tompkins
whatever he calls for," and snatching up his
hat, which was lying on the bar, Taylor left the
saloon.</p>

<p>"What is it to be, sir?" asked Jerry, when they
were alone.</p>

<p>"Whisky straight, if you please," was the prompt
reply, "and, Jerry, I'll just step inside this door to
drink it," and pushing open the door which led to
the little stall-like rooms, he waited for Jerry to
bring him his whisky there.</p>

<p>Mr. Tompkins was a cautious policeman, you see.
He was careful&mdash;indeed, most anxious, not to bring
reproach on the excellent body of men to which he
belonged.</p>

<p>Jerry soon made his appearance with a liberal
dose of "poison," which Tompkins swallowed as if
he loved it, and then, with a cheerful good-day, he
went out.</p>

<p>Neither Taylor nor Stark was in sight. The first,
on emerging from the saloon, had hurried down
the street. The other had let him get some distance
ahead and then had followed him.</p>

<p>They kept on in this way until they had reached
the vicinity of Bond Street and Broadway, when
quickening his pace, Stark came up with Taylor,
and slapping him on the back, said in a matter-of-fact
tone:</p>

<p>"Mr. Taylor, I should be pleased with the favor
of your company for a short distance."</p>

<p>"Who the devil are you?" exclaimed Taylor,
turning upon him with a start.</p>

<p>"I am an officer of the law and you are my prisoner,"
was the stern reply.</p>

<p>"I don't know about that."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> do. And let me tell you, Jimmie, it will be
best for you to go along with me quietly, understand?"</p>

<p>"Where are you going to take me to?"</p>

<p>"The central office."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Byrnes is anxious to have a good look at
you."</p>

<p>"He won't get much out of me."</p>

<p>"That's all right. Every man has a right to keep
his mouth shut and his tongue still if he can."</p>

<p>"Well, I can."</p>

<p>"It's nice to have a good opinion of one's self,
Jimmie. And now step off a little faster, if you
please."</p>

<p>Taylor apparently had given up all thoughts of
resisting, and walked on by the detective's side
without another word.</p>

<p>On arriving at the central office he was locked
up, and a letter purporting to be signed by him,
was sent to his saloon, informing Jerry that he had
suddenly been called out of town on business and
would not be back that night.</p>

<p>All this having been accomplished, Stark hastened
back to the place where Old Spicer and
Killett had established their headquarters, and reported.</p>

<p>He then went out to make the rounds between
the three points at which it was suspected Chamberlain
would be most likely to show up, namely,
Cora Bell's rooms, his own boarding-place, and his
lodging-house.</p>

<p>Shortly after he had gone out Crowley made his
appearance, and a single glance at his face convinced
both Killett and Old Spicer that something
of importance had happened.</p>

<p>"Ah, sir, you're welcome," said Old Spicer; "take
a seat at the table here."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," and stepping forward, the new-comer
sat down.</p>

<p class="center">OLD SPICER'S SPEAKING-TUBE.</p>


<p>"Well, Crowley, what have you to offer?" asked
Killett, with a great show of interest.</p>

<p>"We have tracked Hawks and Klinkhammer, by
different routes, to the same hotel&mdash;a quiet affair uptown,"
was the answer.</p>

<p>"And are they there now?"</p>

<p>"Yes; closeted in No. 24 with a guest."</p>

<p>"Is the guest a new arrival?" asked Old Spicer.</p>

<p>"I was told not&mdash;that is, he has occupied his room,
off and on, for several months."</p>

<p>"Off and on, eh? That is, he goes and comes as
he pleases."</p>

<p>"Exactly."</p>

<p>"Humph! What's his name?"</p>

<p>"Bissell&mdash;E. E. Bissell he signs himself."</p>

<p>"Young or old?"</p>

<p>"Young&mdash;that is, under thirty."</p>

<p>"Who's on duty there?" asked Killett.</p>

<p>"Rouse and Quackenbush."</p>

<p>"Well, Old Spicer, one of us ought to look after
this matter, while the other waits for news of
Chamberlain here."</p>

<p>"I believe I'd better go up to the hotel," said Old
Spicer, after a moment's reflection.</p>

<p>"Very good, then, I'll stay here."</p>

<p>"We can keep each other posted as to our movements,
eh?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, and we should be careful to do so."</p>

<p>"All right; I will go with Crowley, then, unless
you want him here."</p>

<p>"I was just going to suggest that I might want
him."</p>

<p>"All right, you keep him, and I'll find my way
to the hotel alone;" and Old Spicer went out.</p>

<p>He took the elevated road up town and soon arrived
at the hotel.</p>

<p>He found Quackenbush on the lookout, and learned
from him that Rouse was endeavoring to catch some
fragments of the conversation that was going on in
No. 24.</p>

<p>"What!" he exclaimed, "isn't he in the next
room?"</p>

<p>"No," was the reply, "there is no chance for
that. On one side there is a short hall, a passageway,
and on the other a room that is occupied by a
gentleman and his wife."</p>

<p>"Hum. Well, there must be a room overhead."</p>

<p>"Lord, yes. I never thought of that."</p>

<p>Old Spicer hurried to the landlord, who happened
to be in the office.</p>

<p>After a moment's conversation, he asked:</p>

<p>"What's the number of the room over twenty-four?"</p>

<p>The landlord considered the question for a moment
and then said:</p>

<p>"Thirty-six."</p>

<p>"Good! give me the key to thirty-six."</p>

<p>"What do you want of it, sir?"</p>

<p>Old Spicer gave him a hurried but plausible explanation.</p>

<p>The key was at once handed to him.</p>

<p>He went back to Quackenbush.</p>

<p>"Come with me," he said. "I shall take Rouse
up to thirty-six with me, and I want you to remain
in the vicinity of twenty-four, so that, in case they
leave the room, you can follow them."</p>

<p>"All right, sir," and the two went upstairs.</p>

<p>They found Rouse in the little passage at the side
of the room. He had been at work boring a hole
through the plastering, but unfortunately had
chosen the wrong spot, and so his hole had come out
in a closet on the other side.</p>

<p>"Come with me, Reub," said Old Spicer; "Quackenbush
will remain here."</p>

<p>"It would be worth big money to know just what
is being said in there," returned Rouse regretfully.</p>

<p>"Of course, and that's what I am bound to find
out."</p>

<p>"How do you propose to do it?" asked Rouse, in
surprise.</p>

<p>"There is a room overhead."</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly."</p>

<p>"And in that room is a ventilating flue, which
runs down through the room below and out through
the roof above."</p>

<p>"I see! I see!" exclaimed Rouse, in high glee.
"We have only to reach the ventilator to hear all
that is going on in Bissell's room."</p>

<p>"Right, provided the ventilator in twenty-four is
not closed."</p>

<p>"I've no fear of that&mdash;they're never closed."</p>

<p>"Very good; then we are likely to hear something
to our advantage."</p>

<p>By this time they had reached room No. 36, and,
thrusting the key into the lock, Old Spicer opened
the door.</p>

<p>His eyes at once sought the ventilator.</p>

<p>It was over the mantel-piece and at a considerable
distance from the floor.</p>

<p>"How can we get at it?" asked Rouse.</p>

<p>Old Spicer cast a rapid glance about the room.</p>

<p>"Nothing here that will answer the purpose," he
muttered. Then catching Rouse by the sleeve, he
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Come with me," and he conducted him to a
private sitting-room opposite, the door of which was
open.</p>

<p>A strong and fair-sized table stood in the center of
the room.</p>

<p>"Take hold of it," said Old Spicer, and within one
minute that table was standing in front of the mantel-piece
in Room 36.</p>

<p>"Now, then," continued the old detective, "bring
a couple of stout chairs, these in this room are too
frail to stand on."</p>

<p>Rouse vanished, but soon returned with the chairs,
which he placed upon the table.</p>

<p>Old Spicer then locked the door, and the two men
mounted on to the elevated chairs and placed their
ears to the ventilator.</p>

<p>The next instant a smile of satisfaction spread
over both their faces.</p>

<p>"A regular speaking-tube," whispered Rouse.</p>

<p>"Remember that!" returned Old Spicer in his ear;
"and on no account utter a word above the lowest
whisper."</p>

<p>Rouse nodded, and both gave their undivided attention
to what was being said in the room below.</p>

<p>It was Mr. E. E. Bissell who was speaking. There
could be no doubt about that, and he was talking
right to the point.</p>

<p>"There's no use continuing this interview a moment
longer," he was saying. "The man's dead, I
admit that fact; but such a bungling piece of work
I never heard of before."</p>

<p>"It wasn't a job to be proud of," muttered Barney.</p>

<p>"I should say it wasn't! However, he <i>is</i> dead;
and while Reed, of the Consolidated Road, has hit
pretty near the mark, neither he nor any other live
man suspects that I am mixed up in the affair;
hence, so long as you two keep your mouths shut, I
am satisfied."</p>

<p>"We're as dumb as oysters," asserted Barney.</p>

<p>"Dot's schust vhat ve are," chimed in Jake.</p>

<p>"I'm glad to hear it. And now I am going to
pay you in full, and add a couple of thousand on
one condition."</p>

<p>"Vhat vos dot condition, Mr. Pissell?" asked
Jake eagerly.</p>

<p>"That you both solemnly swear never, as long as
you live, to enter the State of Connecticut again."</p>

<p>"Hem, dot vos schust a leetle hard, Mr. Pissell."</p>

<p>"May be it is; but how can you earn a thousand
dollars a piece so easily?"</p>

<p>"Dere vos somedings in dot, I confess."</p>

<p>"Of course, and so you swear do you?"</p>

<p>"Vell, vhat you say, Parney, schall ve swear?"</p>

<p>"Of course," answered Barney, impatiently, "you
know as well as I do, there's nothing else for us to
do."</p>

<p>"Ah-ha!" exclaimed Bissell, "you never intended
to return to Connecticut."</p>

<p>"Not likely," responded Barney, dryly. "I
fancy our necks are worth as much to us as yours is
to you."</p>

<p>"Put," Jake hastened to ask, "you vill gif us der
extra dousands all der same, eh?"</p>

<p>"You <i>bet</i> he will!" growled Barney.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," exclaimed Bissell, with alacrity, "I
don't care what motives keep you out of that state,
or, better still, out of the country. I am only too
willing to pay you, so long as you <i>do</i> keep out.
And now here's your money. Adding the $2000 it
makes $12,000, or $6000 apiece. Pretty good pay for
one night's work, eh, boys?"</p>

<p>"No more than we fairly earned, sir," retorted
Barney; "though, as you say, there was a little
bungling."</p>

<p>"I find no fault, you understand," said Bissell.
"Indeed, it was I who set the price, and if it only
leads to what I hope and expect it will, I am a good
deal more than satisfied."</p>

<p>"The lady has heard of the&mdash;the <i>accident</i>?" said
Barney inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Ye-yes, I believe she has."</p>

<p>"How did she take it?"</p>

<p>"Made a great fuss at first, but I hope that's over
by this time."</p>

<p>"Oh, she'll come round, never fear. She had to
make a little fuss, you know, for appearance sake."</p>

<p>"That's it, exactly."</p>

<p>"Well, we wish you luck, Mr. Bissell, and now,
good day."</p>

<p>"Good-day, gentlemen&mdash;but stay! one word:
When do you leave New York, and in what direction?"</p>

<p>"We leave this very day, and we're going to
Mexico or Central America."</p>

<p>"You couldn't have chosen more wisely. I wish
you the best of luck and continued prosperity."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir."</p>

<p>"I shall always feel an interest in your welfare.
Write to me, when you get settled down there."</p>

<p>"We'll do it, sir.</p>

<p>"You know my address?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Emory E. Bissell. But shall we direct to
this hotel?"</p>

<p>"You may as well. But never mind the Emory;
perhaps we've used that name too freely already
among the wooden nutmegs, E. E. Bissell will do."</p>

<p>"All right, sir, we'll remember. And now is
there anything more to say?"</p>

<p>"I wish you could tell me how Conductor Mason
and Peter Coffey are coming out in this affair?"</p>

<p>"That's more than we know ourselves, sir. They
were so closely connected with Way in the illicit
liquor trade and otherwise, that it's more than likely
to go hard with them."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry; but I see no help for it."</p>

<p>"There is no help for it&mdash;if we're to get off scot-free."</p>

<p>"Well, you'd better do that&mdash;if you can."</p>

<p>"We mean to. And now, once more, good day."</p>

<p>"Good day," and the two worthies were gone.</p>

<p class="center">DETECTIVES IN A TIGHT SPOT.</p>


<p>"Come," exclaimed Old Spicer, and, lightly
springing from the table, he and Rouse hurried from
the room.</p>

<p>They rushed down-stairs, through the office, and
overtook Quackenbush just outside the hotel door.</p>

<p>"Where are they?" asked Old Spicer, breathlessly.</p>

<p>Quackenbush pointed them out just as they were
turning the next corner above.</p>

<p>"Go back and watch Bissell," he whispered.
"Rouse and I will follow them up."</p>

<p>Quackenbush returned to the hotel, while Old
Spicer and Rouse followed the murderers.</p>

<p>They walked across town till they reached Third
Avenue, then taking the elevated road, they proceeded
to Grand Street, where they alighted.</p>

<p>Hurrying down Grand Street, they turned into a
side street, and, after walking some distance, stopped
before a dingy-looking building; then, with a hasty
glance around, they entered the basement, which,
to all appearances, was fitted up as a saloon.</p>

<p>"Come," said Old Spicer, starting to descend the
steps.</p>

<p>"Hold up a minute!" exclaimed Rouse, "I know
this place. It's about the worst in town."</p>

<p>"No matter, we must enter it."</p>

<p>"All right. But, if you're bound to go in, we'd
better disguise ourselves, and we'd better have
help."</p>

<p>"That's reasonable enough."</p>

<p>"Then come around the corner. There's a cop
that'll keep an eye on the place till we get back."</p>

<p>"Beckon to him."</p>

<p>Rouse did so, and the policeman crossed the street
to them.</p>

<p>An arrangement was soon made with him, and
the two detectives hurried away.</p>

<p>In less than ten minutes they were back, thoroughly
disguised as sailors, and accompanied by
two friends&mdash;shipmates.</p>

<p>They now entered the saloon, and looked about
them.</p>

<p>Not a soul did they see but a sleepy-looking boy
sitting on a box behind the bar.</p>

<p>"Got a place where we can sit down, and have a
social glass?" asked Old Spicer.</p>

<p>The boy looked up, considered for a moment, and
then, pointing to a door, nodded.</p>

<p>Old Spicer at once opened the door, and, followed
by his party, entered the inner room.</p>

<p>Here were about a dozen tables, each with four
chairs about it.</p>

<p>Three of the tables were occupied; two of them
with the full complement of four, the other with but
three men.</p>

<p>Two of these three men at the third table were
Barney and Jake; their companion was clearly the
proprietor of the place.</p>

<p>Old Spicer selected the next table to that occupied
by the trio, and placed himself where he could both
see and hear what was going on among his nearest
neighbors. His comrades quickly took the other
seats.</p>

<p>The proprietor and his two friends at once ceased
speaking, and regarded the quartet of sailors with
looks of suspicion and surprise.</p>

<p>"Where's that sleepy boy we saw in the cabin,
and who ordered us into this devil's hold?" demanded
Old Spicer. "Is he going to keep us waiting
all night for our grog?"</p>

<p>The proprietor slowly arose to his feet.</p>

<p>"You want grog, do you?" he asked, drawing
near their table.</p>

<p>"That's just what we want," answered Old
Spicer, emphatically&mdash;"rum, mind ye, cap'n,
genuine St. Croix rum."</p>

<p>"That's it, shipmate," exclaimed Rouse; "no
belly-wash for us."</p>

<p>"It's rum all around, is it?" asked the proprietor,
eying each one of the party in turn.</p>

<p>"It is that," answered Rouse. "And say, skipper,
you may as well bring a bottle."</p>

<p>"A bottle from which the cork has never been
removed," added Old Spicer.</p>

<p>"All right, I have just what you want;" and the
proprietor quietly left the room.</p>

<p>Barney and Jake watched the quartet narrowly,
but hardly spoke while their friend was away.</p>

<p>Presently he returned with a bottle and four
glasses on a good-sized waiter.</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed Old Spicer, as he set down
the waiter, "ain't you going to take a toothful
with us for sociability's sake?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course, if you wish it," was the reply,
and slipping over to the other table, he took up his
own glass, which was still partially filled, and
raised it to his lips.</p>

<p>"None of that!" cried Rouse, sharply. "Throw
that stuff away and fill fair of this bottle."</p>

<p>"Stuff?" retorted the proprietor, "Why, this is
good French brandy, man."</p>

<p>"The deuce it is! How cursed lonesome it must
be!"</p>

<p>"Lonesome? Why?"</p>

<p>"Because it ain't likely there's another thimbleful
in all America."</p>

<p>"What're givin' us? Do you mean to say that I
haven't got plenty of French brandy in my establishment?"</p>

<p>"I mean to say just this: There is more brandy
used in the one city of Paris alone than is manufactured
in all France. How, then, is it likely that
much of the pure stuff can pass our custom-houses."</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!" laughed Barney, "if any of the Simon
Pure could get as far as the custom-houses, I'll warrant
it wouldn't get any further. Our government
officials know too well what's expected of them to
let it slip through their fingers."</p>

<p>"Right, shipmate!" exclaimed Rouse, "they'd
prefer to let it slip down their insatiable throats."</p>

<p>"Well," exclaimed Old Spicer, suddenly, "pure
or impure, I see you've disposed of your brandy at
last, landlord, and so now come over and help us
out with our rum."</p>

<p>The landlord, drawing his chair after him, joined
them at their table. Rouse filled his glass, gave a
toast, and was careful to see that the old man drank
it off. Then a suspicion that the liquor might have
been tampered with was removed.</p>

<p>"What ship do you fellows belong to?" asked the
proprietor, while Rouse was refilling his glass.</p>

<p>"No ship at all," was the answer.</p>

<p>"What craft, then?"</p>

<p>"The three-masted schooner Miranda, in the West
Indian trade."</p>

<p>"Oh! ah! that's why you think so much of St.
Croix rum, eh?"</p>

<p>"Exactly. We know the taste, and we know
how much of the stuff we can stand, don't you see?"</p>

<p>"I see; but it seems to me you are confoundedly
cautious for sailors."</p>

<p>"May be so; but they say a burnt child dreads the
fire, and we've been caught a time or two."</p>

<p>"Been taken in and done for, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but no matter, you're an honest-looking set
here, and seeing that the grog's good, we'll throw
caution to the wind and enjoy ourselves," and the
bottle circulated freely, indeed, so freely that it was
soon empty and another ordered.</p>

<p>The landlord being now convinced that the sailors
were all right, and better, that they were getting
very drunk, returned to Barney and Jake, who had
remained all this time quietly at the other table.</p>

<p>At first they conversed in low tones, but soon almost
all they said reached the ears of the detectives.</p>

<p>"Yes, old pal," were the first words Old Spicer
distinctly heard, "I think I can manage the matter
for you. I don't know the chap, but from the description
you've given of him, and the directions as
to where he may be found, I think I can get at him,
and produce him in the place you name."</p>

<p>"And you will do it?"</p>

<p>"If you think it worth the sum I want."</p>

<p>"It's a tamned pig brice, Pill Punce," exclaimed
Jake.</p>

<p>"Ay," was the reply: "but if we can manage to
give the detective the slip, I'll warrant he'll be willing
enough to pay it."</p>

<p>"Of course, of course," assented Barney; "we
won't dispute your price, Bill."</p>

<p>"Then we understand each other, do we?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so; but to make certain just go over
the programme, will you?"</p>

<p>"Well, after I've found this fellow, Chamberlain,
I'm to get him over to the bay, where the Bouncing
Betsy lies, and where you will meet us. In case we
don't find you at old Flipper's, I am to take the lad
on board the schooner at once, which, when you're
all aboard, will sail for the quarries, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, for the island, so-called."</p>

<p>"Correct. And there, in Canter's Hole, all will
be safe till the schooner sails for the Gulf, when you
can all get out of the country without any one's
dreaming how it was managed."</p>

<p>"Right, by Jove! that is&mdash;&mdash;" And here Barney
came to an abrupt pause.</p>

<p>At this time there were not less than a dozen men
in the place, besides the four detectives, every one
of them desperate characters, and warm friends of
Bill Bunce, the proprietor.</p>

<p>At the moment Barney paused his eye happened
to rest on the quartet at the next table, and he was
struck by the eager interest depicted on one or two
of the faces.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" demanded Bunce, turning
sharply round.</p>

<p>"The matter is," cried Barney, starting to his feet
and drawing a couple of revolvers, "that these fellows
are a pack of cursed spies, and I know it!"</p>

<p>"Spies!" echoed every man in the room. "Spies!
Kill the bloody wretches! don't let one of 'em escape!"</p>

<p>"We're in for it, by Jove!" exclaimed Rouse.
"Let us keep well together, and shoot to kill."</p>

<p>"Ay!" said Old Spicer, "but I should awfully
hate to have the gallows cheated of its lawful prey.
I wish I could take those two villains back with me
unharmed."</p>

<p>By this time Bill Bunce and his friends had got
between the detectives and the outlets, and were
preparing for a deadly fight.</p>

<p>"Do you really mean to say that you will be so
rash as to fire upon us?" asked Old Spicer. "You
must know that sooner or later you will have to pay
dearly for it if you do."</p>

<p>"We know mighty well that we shall have to pay
for it devilish soon if we don't," retorted Bunce;
"and that's enough for us to know. Let 'em have
it, boys!" and at least half a dozen shots were fired,
and one of the detectives was slightly wounded.</p>

<p>"Fire!" exclaimed Old Spicer, in a determined
voice, and as each detective had two revolvers, eight
shots rang out, and two of the enemy fell dead,
while four more were wounded, Jake Klinkhammer
being among the latter.</p>

<p>The firing now became general, and it was difficult
to say who was getting the best of it, when the
door from the saloon was suddenly thrown open and
the boy's voice was heard to exclaim:</p>

<p>"Scatter! the cops are coming!"</p>

<p>Almost in an instant the place was cleared of
Bunce's men, and a moment later a sergeant of police,
followed by six men, entered.</p>

<p class="center">JAKE KLINKHAMMER'S POCKETBOOK&mdash;OLD SPICER
SURPRISED.</p>


<p>"Ah! sergeant, you never were more welcome,"
cried Rouse. "Grab that young whelp in the
saloon, and then let's see who's hurt here."</p>

<p>"The boy's all right," returned the sergeant.
"One of my men has him fast; but who the deuce
are you?"</p>

<p>Rouse explained.</p>

<p>"Ah! And this gentleman?"</p>

<p>"Is Old Spicer. You've heard of him?"</p>

<p>"Heard of him? I should say so! Are you hurt,

<p>"Slightly; nothing to speak of, though. But our
comrades, I fear, have suffered."</p>

<p>"What! these two? Are these our men?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Who's this one?"</p>

<p>"Matt Quinn," answered Rouse.</p>

<p>"Well, poor fellow, he's as dead as a door-nail.
And this?"</p>

<p>"Nat Skinner."</p>

<p>"He's badly hurt, but I reckon he'll come out all
right in the end. Now let's look at this pile of carrion,"
and he turned to where the dead and wounded
of the enemy were lying.</p>

<p>"Lord! gentlemen," he exclaimed, "you did
mighty well for the time you were at it. How many
were there against you?"</p>

<p>"Twelve."</p>

<p>"Twelve? And seven of them are here&mdash;four
dead, and the rest badly wounded. Who's this
one?"</p>

<p>"A Jew," said Rouse.</p>

<p>"A Jew, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes," explained Old Spicer, "a noted rascal,
Jake Klinkhammer by name."</p>

<p>"Oho! he's saved your state a trial. Do you know
any of the rest?"</p>

<p>"Not one. The two greatest villains have got
away."</p>

<p>"Who are they?"</p>

<p>"Barney Hawks, and Bill Bunce, the proprietor of
this place."</p>

<p>"That's a pity. How did they manage it? Where
did they go to?"</p>

<p>"Haven't the slightest idea. It seemed as though
they vanished through that wall yonder."</p>

<p>"Probably they did. Bring an ax, Finch."</p>

<p>An ax was brought, and used with such reckless
effect, that soon an opening into a passage leading
into a building fronting on another street, was
discovered.</p>

<p>"They're off for this time, sure," said the sergeant,
when he had examined the passage; "but we'll take
possession of this place, and if Bunce ever ventures
back, we'll nab him anyhow."</p>

<p>"Well," exclaimed Old Spicer, suddenly, "as
Hawks has got away from us, there are one or two
others who must be looked after without an instant's
delay and so we must be going."</p>

<p>"One moment!" exclaimed Rouse, "haven't you
forgot something?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"The Jew&mdash;he ought to have something about his
clothes."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes. Sergeant, help us search the Jew's
body: there ought to be a big pile of money on
him."</p>

<p>They searched the body, and a trifle over $6000
was found.</p>

<p>"There must be more than that," said Old Spicer.
"He had a very large sum of money before that
$6000 was paid to him&mdash;I am sure of it."</p>

<p>"How much?"</p>

<p>"About $15,000, I should say."</p>

<p>"How'd he come by it?"</p>

<p>"If my suspicions are correct, he and Hawks were
engaged, just before they left our city, in one of the
boldest robberies, and in one of the most cowardly
double murders ever perpetrated in this country."</p>

<p>"What! do you mean the Marsden affair?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"Great Jupiter! and so this is one of the villains?"</p>

<p>"Yes; from a private dispatch put into my hands
only a little while ago, I am sure of it."</p>

<p>"What can he have done with his share of the
plunder, then? There don't seem to be any of it
about him."</p>

<p>"Hold up a moment!" exclaimed Rouse, suddenly
thrusting his hand into an inside vest-pocket
of the dead man, "let's see what we've got here,"
and he drew forth a pocket-book.</p>

<p>He opened it, and found within a few hundred
dollars in gold and bank-notes, and a bill of exchange
for fifteen thousand dollars.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" exclaimed Rouse, "this sharp fellow,
while he was on his roundabout way to Hudson
Street this morning, stopped at a brother Jew's in
Bond Street; and he must have managed in the few
minutes he was there to exchange his money for
this bit of paper."</p>

<p>"That's it," nodded Old Spicer.</p>

<p>"Well," said the sergeant, "who shall take
charge of his effects?"</p>

<p>"I wish you would, sergeant," returned Spicer,
"and hand them over to the inspector for safe-keeping,
for we have really got warm work before
us."</p>

<p>"All right," and after a few friendly words, Old
Spicer and Rouse went out.</p>

<p>"Now, then," said the former, in some perplexity,
when they had reached the sidewalk, "the question
is, where to go to first?"</p>

<p>"I'll answer that," replied Rouse, quickly. "I'm
for getting on to the track of Barney Hawks again.
Go you to Killett, and with him hunt down Chamberlain."</p>

<p>"That will be best, I think," and so the two detectives
parted.</p>

<p>Old Spicer hastened to the point where he had
left Killett. He did not find him there, but he
found one of his men, who informed him that he
was to conduct him to his friend.</p>

<p>The old detective intimated that he was ready to
start, and the two set out at once.</p>

<p>Old Spicer was so absorbed in his own thoughts
that he did not think to ask his conductor where
he was taking him, and so he was greatly surprised
when he once more found himself before the hotel
where he had listened to the conversation between
Emory E. Bissell and Barney and Jake.</p>

<p>"What!" he exclaimed, "is Killett here?"</p>

<p>"Yes," was the reply.</p>

<p>"What is he doing here?"</p>

<p>"We followed Chamberlain to this hotel; we
heard him ask for E. E. Bissell, and on his being
informed that the gentleman was out, heard him say
that he would go up to his room and wait for him
there. We saw him enter room No. 24, and heard
him lock the door. Then one of us remained here
to watch, while the other went back to report to
Killett."</p>

<p>"But Quackenbush&mdash;where's Quackenbush?"</p>

<p>"Here I am, sir," answered that detective, suddenly
coming up.</p>

<p>"You were left here to watch Bissell?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"You haven't lost sight of him?"</p>

<p>"Hardly for a moment."</p>

<p>"He left the hotel soon after his visitors went
away?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"You followed him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Where did he go to?"</p>

<p>"To several places of no great importance, and
finally he fetched round to the hotel again."</p>

<p>"How long ago was that?"</p>

<p>"Just now; he has just gone up to his room."</p>

<p>Old Spicer turned to the other detective.</p>

<p>"Where is Killett?" he asked.</p>

<p>"In room 36," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Ah! he saw that was his best chance to learn
what was passing in 24. I wonder how he happened
to tumble to that racket."</p>

<p>"I suspect the landlord put him up to it."</p>

<p>"No doubt. I had forgotten I told him what I
wanted of the key. I think I'll go up to 36 at once.
And you gentlemen be on hand in the neighborhood
of 24, in case we may want you."</p>

<p>"All right, sir," and the three detectives ascended
the first flight of stairs in company.</p>

<p>At the landing Quackenbush and the other detective
left Old Spicer and placed themselves in the
vicinity of Bissell's room. The old man ascended
to the third floor, and, hastening to No. 36, knocked
on the door.</p>

<p>"Who's there?" came in a low whisper from the
other side.</p>

<p>"It's me, Adam&mdash;Old Spicer."</p>

<p>"Thank goodness!" and the door was hastily
opened and the old detective admitted.</p>

<p>"I'm mighty glad you've come," whispered
Killett, "you're just in time. Chamberlain has
been waiting in the room under this ever since I've
been here; but the man he came to see was out and
has only just returned."</p>

<p>"I am fortunate, then," said Old Spicer.</p>

<p>"Yes, jump up on the table and mount one of
the chairs."</p>

<p>Old Spicer did so, while Killett took possession of
the other chair.</p>

<p>In another moment they were listening at the
ventilator.</p>

<p class="center">CHAMBERLAIN'S MYSTERIOUS FRIEND&mdash;A STRANGE
DISAPPEARANCE.</p>


<p>"Of course, I'm making myself at home here,"
Chamberlain was saying. "Why shouldn't I, I'd
like to know?"</p>

<p>"Well," returned another voice&mdash;Bissell's&mdash;"the
fact is, when a gentleman goes out, he likes to feel
that his private room is held sacred, even by his
friends. I don't see what the landlord could have
been thinking of to let you come up here."</p>

<p>"Why, he knew me&mdash;knew that whenever you
were stopping here I had been in the habit of coming
and going as I pleased; and so, when I told him
I was tired and would like to come up here and rest
while waiting for you, he made no objection.
That's how it was."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know that any great damage has
been done this time, but I wish, Hen, as a general
thing, you'd keep out of my room when I am not in
it."</p>

<p>"Look here, Em Bissell, ain't you putting on
more frills than your shirt front'll carry?"</p>

<p>"I fancy I know my business, sir. And now
permit me to ask to what fortunate circumstance I
am indebted for the pleasure of your company to-day?"</p>

<p>"Thunder! What's come over you, Em? Don't
your food agree with you, man?"</p>

<p>"<i>I</i>'m all right; but to be plain with you, I should
like to be alone."</p>

<p>"Oho! that's the way the wind sets, is it? Well,
so far as I'm concerned, you'll be alone pretty
blamed sudden. We've a little matter of business
to transact first, however."</p>

<p>"What is it&mdash;if I may ask?"</p>

<p>"What is it! You know blamed well what it is.
Just fork over that money I gave you the other
day."</p>

<p>"Money? What money?"</p>

<p>"Look here, Em Bissell, don't you undertake to
play any of your funny business on <i>me</i>. I gave
you $22,000 on Monday to keep for me. I want it
now, and by the Eternal! I'll have it, if I have to
cut your black heart out to get it!"</p>

<p>Old Spicer turned to Killett, and a look of deep
meaning passed between them.</p>

<p>"Move from your tracks, or lift a finger, Hen
Chamberlain, and I ring this bell," exclaimed Bissell
hastily, "and as sure as I do, I give you up
as a murderer!"</p>

<p>"Pshaw! what do I care for your cursed bell
and your threats? There's a dozen ways out of this
hotel, and before a man could get to the top of one
flight of stairs, I'd be at the bottom of another,
and lost in the crowd on the avenue."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, if you are not out of this room inside
of two minutes, you will have a chance to
try that experiment provided you're alive to try it."</p>

<p>"Oho! you threaten my life, do you? See here,
Bissell, before we go any further, just tell me why
you have pretended to take such an interest in me
during all these years; why you have nursed all
my evil inclinations; why you have tempted me
to commit crime after crime, and why, now that
I have, at your suggestion, committed one that puts
a noose about my neck, you turn against me?"</p>

<p>"Why does any man do such things?"</p>

<p>"From self-interest, I suppose, or, perhaps more
often, to revenge some wrong."</p>

<p>"Exactly, and those two are the motives that
have influenced me."</p>

<p>"But great Scott! man&mdash;I never injured you."</p>

<p>"Personally, you have not."</p>

<p>"Then what do you want to bring me to ruin
for?"</p>

<p>"I want to strike another through you."</p>

<p>"Who, in the fiend's name?"</p>

<p>"Who do you suppose?"</p>

<p>"I can't think. There are but two persons on
earth who care a tinker's button what becomes of
me."</p>

<p>"And who are those two?"</p>

<p>"My father and mother."</p>

<p>"Who do you mean when you say your father
and mother?"</p>

<p>"Why, Henry A. Chamberlain and his wife."</p>

<p>"The worthy couple who live at No. 10 Franklin
Street, New Haven?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"Do you really think they are your father and
mother?"</p>

<p>"They are all the father and mother I have ever
known."</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! Well, I might tell you that they are
no more your parents than they are mine. I might
tell you that your name is not Chamberlain, but
Curtis. I might tell you that there are certain persons&mdash;one
in particular&mdash;who are deeply interested
in your welfare. But what's the use? I will only
tell you that there is one person whom, for years, it
has been my aim and purpose to crush; that I saw
I could best accomplish my end by striking at you;
that, therefore, I sought you out when you were but
a mere lad at Eton school; that I took you in hand
and led you, step by step, to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The devil! I see it all now, curse you!"</p>

<p>"Ah! you do see it at last, do you?"</p>

<p>"I do; and now give me my money before I tear
you limb from limb."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, boy: don't you see that I wheedled
the money out of you on purpose, so that you
might not have the means to escape from justice?
Why, my revenge wouldn't be complete if you
escaped the gallows. And do you think I will deliberately
give you the means to escape?"</p>

<p>"Look out, man. You'll drive me too far if you
ain't careful."</p>

<p>"Why, Hen, I planned every move you made, and
you never moved but to put the halter more surely
about your neck. Can't you guess now why I introduced
you to Cora Bell? Can't you see why I took
you to Jim Taylor's place? A good fellow enough,
Jim is; but I knew mighty well that if he worked
with you all he'd want would be a little squeeze
from somebody to give you away as quick as chain-lightning.
See if I'm not right."</p>

<p>"You're an infernal villain!"</p>

<p>"Oh, may be so; but I can afford to be whatever
I please. You nor no living soul on earth can
touch me."</p>

<p>"Can't, eh?" and there was a rush forward, a
yell, a loud ringing of bells, the sound of hurrying
feet, and general confusion.</p>

<p>Old Spicer and Killett sprung from their chairs to
the table, from the table to the floor, and rushing
from the room, flew to the stairs, and descended
without hardly touching a step. In another moment
they were at the entrance to No. 24, where
quite a little crowd had already gathered.</p>

<p>Quackenbush and two other detectives were in
the room. Bissell was stretched upon the bed, to
all appearance dangerously wounded.</p>

<p>Chamberlain was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>"Where's Chamberlain?" asked Old Spicer,
eagerly.</p>

<p>"Got away," answered Quackenbush.</p>

<p>"Got away! In the name of the great Lecoq,
how did he manage it?"</p>

<p>"Knocked me down, threw a hall-porter on top
of me, and was gone before I could get the fool off."</p>

<p>"But these men, what were they doing?"</p>

<p>"Lord! I don't know."</p>

<p>"I was at the head of the stairs yonder. We
were attracting too much attention standing here
together," explained Crowley.</p>

<p>"And I," said the third detective, "was at the
back stairs."</p>

<p>"Did he make off in that direction?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"You tried to stop him, of course?"</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"What did he do?"</p>

<p>"Why, just knocked me clean down the stairs,
that's all."</p>

<p>"You were there, then, when he came down."</p>

<p>"Yes; but I didn't feel much like stopping him
just then."</p>

<p>"I suppose not. Well, Quackenbush, clear the
room, and let Crowley go for a doctor. Frank, you
stay here. This man is quite as important a prisoner
as either Chamberlain or Taylor."</p>

<p>The wounded man slightly raised his head and
pricked up his ears, at this announcement.</p>

<p>It is a great pity that some of the detectives did
not detect this movement.</p>

<p>Old Spicer and Killett drew a little to one side,
and conversed in eager whispers.</p>

<p>"Chamberlain must be captured at once," said
Old Spicer, emphatically.</p>

<p>"He shall be!" returned Killett, decidedly. "This
man is badly wounded, no doubt; so we can spare
two of the three we have with us, and I'll telephone
to Byrnes to send out Maguire and Frank Mangin;
they'll find him, if anybody can."</p>

<p>Quackenbush and Frank Starr were sent out on
the hunt, and Killett went down to the office, to
telephone to headquarters.</p>

<p>Crowley now came back, and announced that a
surgeon had been summoned, and would shortly
arrive.</p>

<p>Old Spicer, who had for some time been anxious
to get a message to Stricket and Morgan, merely
said:</p>

<p>"All right; stay here for a few moments, please,"
and hurried down-stairs.</p>

<p>Crowley stepped softly to the bed, and took a look
at the wounded prisoner.</p>

<p>"Asleep, or unconscious," he said to himself; and
then, taking up a newspaper and seating himself by
the window, he prepared to take it easy, till Old
Spicer and Killett should return.</p>

<p>Just then some one knocked on the door; and,
not wishing to disturb Bissell, he quietly arose,
crossed the room, and opened the door.</p>

<p>The caller was one of those society fiends yclept
a reporter.</p>

<p>"Hello, officer!" he exclaimed, briskly; "I understand
there's been something of a row up here.
Let's know the merits of the case."</p>

<p>"I don't know them myself," returned Crowley,
evasively, at the same time slipping out into the
corridor and closing the door behind him.</p>

<p>"Oh, pshaw!" urged the reporter, "you must
know something about it. Tell me what you do
know."</p>

<p>"What little I know isn't worth telling. Just
wait till Old Spicer and Killett come up, then you
can question them all you've a mind to&mdash;if they'll
let you."</p>

<p>"What! is Old Spicer in this hotel?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Where is he?"</p>

<p>"Down in the office, I believe."</p>

<p>"Did you say he was coming up here soon?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but if you want to see him, perhaps you'd
better go down to the office."</p>

<p>"No, I reckon I'd better wait here till he comes
up."</p>

<p>"Very well, then you'll excuse me for leaving
you, for I must go in and look after my prisoner."</p>

<p>"Hold up a moment! What's his name?"</p>

<p>"Bissell."</p>

<p>"Emory E. Bissell&mdash;is that it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Badly wounded, isn't he?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Who did it?"</p>

<p>"I'm not sure that I know."</p>

<p>"Who do you think?"</p>

<p>"I don't know that I am at liberty to tell you
that."</p>

<p>"The landlord says he let a fellow named Chamberlain
come up here while Bissell was out, and that
he was still waiting for him when he returned. Was
that the man?"</p>

<p>"It's possible."</p>

<p>"Don't you know he was the fellow?"</p>

<p>"How the deuce can I be certain about it? I
never saw Chamberlain enter the room."</p>

<p>"But didn't you see him come out of it?"</p>

<p>"No, I did not."</p>

<p>"They say he burst out of the room like a mad
bull, and knocked three of you fellows down."</p>

<p>"Well, if he did, I wasn't one of them."</p>

<p>"Where were you?"</p>

<p>"Standing over by the main staircase yonder."</p>

<p>"Then he didn't attempt to get away in that direction?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Where, then?"</p>

<p>"By the back stairs, I have heard."</p>

<p>"Know what the trouble was between Bissell and
Chamberlain?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Is Bissell badly wounded?"</p>

<p>"I should suppose so."</p>

<p>"Is he unconscious?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Just let me take a look at him, will you?"</p>

<p>"I can't do that."</p>

<p>"For goodness' sake, why not? I won't eat the
man."</p>

<p>"It's against orders to admit any one but the doctor."</p>

<p>"Well, is this the doctor coming?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Who's that with him?"</p>

<p>"Old Spicer."</p>

<p>"The deuce it is! But, yes; I would have known
him by the descriptions I have seen of him. Queer
looking cuss, ain't he?"</p>

<p>"He's&mdash;well, he's rather slender, to say the least."</p>

<p>"A sort of Wm. M. Evarts. Ah! good-day, Mr.
Spicer. Good-day, doctor; glad to see you, gentlemen,"
and as the great detective and the surgeon entered
the room with Crowley, the reporter followed
after them, as a matter of course.</p>

<p>"Why, Crowley, where's your prisoner?" demanded
Old Spicer, in startled tones, after a single
glance at the blood-stained bed.</p>

<p>"He's&mdash;Great Scott! He's gone!"</p>

<p>"Gone?" exclaimed the reporter, in his usual
brisk way. "How the devil did he manage to get
away?"</p>

<p class="center">CHAMBERLAIN'S CAPTURE.</p>


<p>"How'd he manage to get away? confound you!"
exclaimed Crowley, turning upon the reporter in
the bitterness of his soul. "He managed it while
my back was turned answering your nonsensical
questions."</p>

<p>"Nonsensical! Look a-here, officer, I can prove
to you in just one minute and a half that my questions
were anything but nonsensical."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't bother me!"</p>

<p>"Well, but how <i>do</i> you suppose he got away?
I'd really like to know that&mdash;good point&mdash;great sensation&mdash;man
supposed to be fatally wounded finds
he's a prisoner&mdash;the trusty officer left in charge
merely steps to the door for a moment to consult
and advise with a well-known gentleman of the
press, when, on turning back, presto, change! the
bird had flown!</p>

<p>"Yes, I can work it in that the greatest mystery
hangs about his disappearance&mdash;that is, you know,
unless we can find out just how he managed it."</p>

<p>"Well," said Old Spicer, suddenly turning upon
the reporter, "I think we can satisfy your laudable
curiosity upon that point."</p>

<p>"Ah! you do, eh! How so, pray?"</p>

<p>"See this closet?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course."</p>

<p>"Well, step a little further this way. You see
there's a door opening from it into the next room.
The place has been so arranged that it can be used
as a closet for either room, you perceive?"</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, to be sure, or so that it might be used
as a passageway&mdash;as in the present case, eh?"</p>

<p>"Exactly. Now, then, the question is, has the
wounded man, in his supposed weakly condition,
been able to escape from the hotel? Crowley,
please summons Killett. We must institute a thorough
search."</p>

<p>"I'll take a hand in that," exclaimed the reporter,
with alacrity, "and I hope I shall find
him."</p>

<p>"Why are you so anxious on that point?" asked
Old Spicer, curiously.</p>

<p>"Why, you see I want to make a little noise in
the world before I start for New Haven to hunt out
the murderer or murderers of Charley Way."</p>

<p>"Oh! you are going to do a little detective work
up there, are you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; I'm jist going to pipe that mystery,
you bet."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I wish you all the success possible&mdash;all
the glory there is left to gain."</p>

<p>"Are you speaking sarcastically, sir?"</p>

<p>"By no means."</p>

<p>"I thought I detected something of the kind in
the tone of your voice."</p>

<p>By this time Killett had made his appearance,
and the detectives, the reporter, and nearly every
one connected with the hotel, spread themselves
through the house in search of the missing man.</p>

<p>After an hour they returned to the point from
whence they had started, and were obliged to confess
that their efforts had been in vain. Emory E.
Bissell had utterly vanished, and left no trace behind!</p>

<p>"Well," said Killett, drawing Old Spicer aside,
and speaking in a low tone, "there can be no question
about it, the fellow was playing 'possum, and
he's got clean away. What had we better do
now?"</p>

<p>"He must be found," said Old Spicer, decidedly.</p>

<p>"No question about that; but where shall we
look first?"</p>

<p>"Have you no suggestion to make on that point
yourself?"</p>

<p>"I think he's still in this neighborhood."</p>

<p>"I think it's quite possible; and, if you're willing,
I'll leave you here for a time and look after another
matter."</p>

<p>"All right, old fellow, only don't let us lose track
of one another."</p>

<p>"Of course we mustn't do that," and Old Spicer, a
little irritated by the escape of both Chamberlain
and Bissell, hurried away.</p>

<p>He went straight to Cora Bell's rooms, and had a
long and serious talk with her. He then went to
the place where he and Killett had spent so much
time earlier in the day, and wrote two long letters,
which he posted with his own hand. After this he
went to Inspector Byrnes' office, on Mulberry Street,
and was closeted with that celebrated detective for
more than two hours; and then, being quite worn
out, he made his way to a neighboring hotel and
went to bed.</p>

<p>Early the next morning he started out again.</p>

<p>A little later he found himself in the Bowery. He
had just crossed Third Street, walking in the direction
of Fourth, when he saw a figure ahead of him
that attracted his attention.</p>

<p>It was that of a rather good-looking young man
of about twenty-three years of age.</p>

<p>The blood tingled in the old detective's veins.
His heart beat faster&mdash;his pulse quicker.</p>

<p>He hurried forward.</p>

<p>The young man turned into a saloon. Old Spicer
followed him.</p>

<p>The young man called for a drink. The detective
did likewise.</p>

<p>The young man cast a suspicious glance at the
elder, threw a nickel on the bar and hurried out.</p>

<p>Old Spicer also threw down a piece of money and
started for the door.</p>

<p>"It must be done now," he thought; "but it will
be a tough job taking him alone."</p>

<p>At that instant he caught sight of two men coming
up the street.</p>

<p>They were Detectives Frank Mangin and James
Maguire.</p>

<p>Old Spicer immediately gave them a signal, and
hurrying forward, they came up in front of the
young man. Old Spicer still remaining behind
him.</p>

<p>"Chamberlain," said Mangin, in a determined
tone of voice, "you are our prisoner."</p>

<p>The street was crowded with people. Chamberlain,
who was a muscular young fellow nearly six
feet tall, uttered a fearful oath, sprung forward,
threw the detective to one side, and drew a revolver.</p>

<p>The crowd instantly scattered.</p>

<p>But the detectives grappled with him, and Old
Spicer coming up quickly, knocked the pistol out of
his hand, while Maguire, striking him a blow in the
side of the head, sent him headlong on the pavement.</p>

<p>In a twinkling of an eye he was on his feet again,
but with a pair of steel bracelets on his wrists, and
after a few hurried words between Old Spicer and
the two detectives, he was marched away to Inspector
Byrnes' office.</p>

<p>"That's all right," said Old Spicer, in a tone of
quiet satisfaction, when they were gone. "Now I
can attend to the other matter," and he took the
Third Avenue elevated road to Harlem River.</p>

<p>Two hours and a half later he returned, and met
Killett, Stark and Rouse in the inspector's office.</p>

<p>"I am very glad indeed to find you here," he
said. "I was afraid I might have to leave without
seeing you."</p>

<p>"Why, what do you mean?" asked Killett, in a
tone of wonder.</p>

<p>"I'm going to Connecticut," replied Spicer.</p>

<p>"What, and give up the chase for Bissell, Hawks
and Bunce?"</p>

<p>"They will all be there by the time I am," said
the old man, quietly.</p>

<p>"How's that?" asked Killett, in great surprise.</p>

<p>"They are all passengers on board the schooner
Bouncing Betsey, which will land them in the
neighborhood of Stony Creek, and I already have
my men on the lookout for them there."</p>

<p>"You have done some pretty tall work to-day, to
find out all that, and put matters into the shape you
have."</p>

<p>"Yes, I have not been idle, neither last night nor
to-day."</p>

<p>"When do you start for home?"</p>

<p>"On the next train."</p>

<p>"I believe I'll go with you. Bunce, of course,
will have to be brought back here."</p>

<p>"Of course he will, and I wish you would bear
me company."</p>

<p>"I suppose the authorities will hold Chamberlain
and Taylor until the governor grants a requisition
for their being taken out of the state?"</p>

<p>"Yes, all that has been arranged."</p>

<p>"And Cora Bell&mdash;what's to be done with her?"</p>

<p>"She will come up to Connecticut the moment I
send for her. Stark or Rouse, I wish one of you,
or if you can't get away, that Cosgrove would come
up with her."</p>

<p>"All right, sir. We'll see to it."</p>

<p>"Well, then, I believe that's all. And now good-bye,
my friends." And after shaking Silas and
Reub by the hand, the old detective hurried away
in company with Adam Killett.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.</a></h2>

<p class="center">ON BOARD THE BOUNCING BETSEY.</p>


<p>The Bouncing Betsey was beating her way up the
Sound in the face of a head wind, and hence her
progress was aggravatingly slow. There were a
goodly number of craft in sight, but none near
enough to distinguish the persons of those on board
the schooner, and so her three worthy passengers
had ventured on deck.</p>

<p>Emory Bissell could not be said to be distinguished
by either a very healthy or a very happy
look. His face was ghastly pale and his step
feeble.</p>

<p>Barney Hawks and Bill Bunce were seated on
what might be called the quarter-deck. Bissell
slowly approached, and when he had almost reached
the couple, Barney pushed a camp-stool toward
him.</p>

<p>The wounded man sank down upon it with a
sigh.</p>

<p>"So Hen Chamberlain gave you a pretty considerable
dig in the ribs, did he?" asked Barney, in the
way of starting conversation.</p>

<p>"He did that, and if the knife hadn't glanced off
exactly as it did, it would have been all over with
me, as sure as you're born."</p>

<p>"What made the cub strike you? I know he's
pretty hot-blooded, but I shouldn't have thought
that of him."</p>

<p>"He resented what he termed my meddling with
his business, I believe."</p>

<p>"And had you done so? I didn't even know that
you two were acquainted."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I have always known Hen, and I have
ventured to give him good advice now and then."</p>

<p>"It must have been good advice if <i>you</i> gave it to
him."</p>

<p>"To be sure, it was so, if he had had the genius
to profit by it."</p>

<p>"But what started you on the run? Didn't you
dare to stay and face the music?"</p>

<p>"Why, you see, his attack upon me could but
draw the attention of the public to me, and knowing
the fact that he has called at my rooms several
times, and remained an hour or so each time, would
be sure to come out and be put down to my disadvantage,
I concluded to dig out while I had an opportunity
to do so."</p>

<p>"I am inclined to think you did wisely," said
Barney, after some moments' reflection.</p>

<p>"But how the deuce did you manage it, in your
condition?" asked Bill Bunce. "If I understood
you rightly last night, there were officers in the
house watching you, if not in your very room."</p>

<p>"It was a pretty sharp piece of work," returned
Bissell, thoughtfully. "A detective was just outside
my door&mdash;some one had called him out the moment
before; two more&mdash;one of them Old Spicer
himself&mdash;were in the office below, and another, I
believe, was on the sidewalk watching the several
entrances. But I knew well enough that my only
chance had come, and I resolved to take it.</p>

<p>"Fortunately, my room was connected with the
next by a doorway cut through the inner wall of a
closet, and the outlet to this room was upon a corridor
running at right angles with that upon which
mine opened.</p>

<p>"I could hear my keeper talking with some one
just outside my door. Cautiously I raised myself in
bed. The next moment I slipped out upon the
floor.</p>

<p>"On my bureau was a bottle of brandy and a glass.
I seized the bottle&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But didn't bother with the glass, I'll go bail,"
interrupted Barney, quickly.</p>

<p>"Not much, you bet. I uncorked the bottle,
placed it to my lips, and took such a drink as I
hadn't had before in a long time. Then, like a flash,
I changed my coat and vest, seized a hat, and disappeared
through the closet door.</p>

<p>"Crossing the adjoining room, I opened the door
on to the corridor. A gentleman and lady were
just passing. I merely bowed, and hurried toward
the private staircase at the rear of the hall.</p>

<p>"I didn't see another soul until I had reached the
floor below. Then two or three ladies and a gentleman
came out of a large room and started toward
the stairs. Before they had had a chance to see me
I slipped into a sort of private reception-room, and,
when they were well out of the way, rushed to the
outside door, opened it, and the next minute was
standing on the sidewalk.</p>

<p>"As good luck would have it, a cab was passing.
I hailed it, the driver stopped, and I sprung inside.</p>

<p>"'Where to?' he asked.</p>

<p>"By Jove! I hadn't thought up to that moment
where I wanted to go to, so I simply said,
'Straight ahead!'</p>

<p>"Fortunately he was headed eastward, and, as I
didn't interfere, he kept on to the river. At sight
of it, what we were talking about yesterday came
over me like a flash of lightning, and thinks I,
'Why shouldn't I join Barney and Jake in their
voyage to the Gulf of Mexico?' The next moment
I decided to do it. And so I told the driver at what
point I wanted to get out, and from there I found
means to be conveyed to the schooner in the bay."</p>

<p>"Were you wise in letting the cabman take you
where you did?" asked Barney, in a somewhat anxious
tone.</p>

<p>"I suppose not," was the reply; "but I was far
too weak to walk, and so had to risk it."</p>

<p>"It may prove a risk that will cost us all dear."</p>

<p>"As matters turned out, I don't think so, my
friend."</p>

<p>"How's that?"</p>

<p>"Why, even if the detectives should happen to
stumble upon that cabman, it isn't at all likely
they'll ever unearth the man who conveyed me to
the bay."</p>

<p>"Who was he?"</p>

<p>"Blessed if I know. I didn't take the trouble to
ask."</p>

<p>"How did you happen to fall in with him?"</p>

<p>"He owned a pretty yacht, and was just going
aboard of her, when he noticed me on the pier.</p>

<p>"'You seem to be looking for some one?' he
said.</p>

<p>"'I was hoping to find an old man who hangs
around this pier a good deal,' I replied, 'and who
owns a small craft in which he takes parties to different
points on the river.'</p>

<p>"'There's no such man about here just now,' said
the gentleman.</p>

<p>"'So I see,' I returned, and I fancy I sighed.</p>

<p>"'You are sick and weak,' he exclaimed quickly.</p>

<p>"'Weak I surely am,' I said; 'but I'd be all
right, I'm sure, if I could only get up the river a
piece.'</p>

<p>"'Well, I'm going up the river. Come on board
my yacht and welcome.'</p>

<p>"I thanked him warmly, and he landed me, as
you know, on board this schooner."</p>

<p>"And why do you think the detectives won't find
him?" asked Barney, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Because I drew out of him that he was on his
way to Newport, from whence he was going to sail
almost immediately to the Bermudas, otherwise I
never would have let him come up alongside the
Bouncing Betsey."</p>

<p>"Well, if he's off for the Bermudas, I reckon it's
all right; for if we have any kind of luck, it's more
than likely we shall be in the Gulf of Mexico, or
even in Mexico itself, before he gets back to New
York."</p>

<p>"That's the way I look at it."</p>

<p>"We've got to make better time than we're making
now to get anywhere," growled Bill Bunce, discontentedly.</p>

<p>"You're right enough there, Bill," said Barney;
"but I suppose the captain's doing the best he can,
so there's no help for it."</p>

<p>"I suppose there isn't; but I've got it beat into me
that this delay will cost us dear."</p>

<p>"I don't see how it can," said Bissell quickly.
"Without the testimony of that yacht-owner they
can't connect any one of us with the Bouncing
Betsey."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not, but they'll do it all the same."</p>

<p>"Why, do you suspect that you and Barney were,
or can be, traced to the schooner?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't think that; for after we got away
from the detectives at my place, we disguised ourselves
so thoroughly that our own mothers never
would have known us, and we took the most roundabout
way to the bay, and came on board at midnight."</p>

<p>"Then I don't see what there is to fear."</p>

<p>"Nor I, so far as caution is concerned. But that
cursed detective they call Old Spicer is like no other
man alive, I believe; and before we know it he'll
drop down upon us&mdash;you'll see."</p>

<p>"Come, come, old fellow, cheer up, or you'll give
us all the horrors, and that's useless."</p>

<p>Presently the wind changed, then it became fair,
and the Bouncing Betsy bounded over the waves at
a lively rate.</p>

<p>Even Bill Bunce, who had so much to make him
sad, became cheerful, and in some measure forgot
his somber forebodings.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.</a></h2>

<p class="center">IN NO MAN'S BAY&mdash;MAG'S HOVEL.</p>


<p>The day passed, the night came on, and out of the
gloom the passenger on board the schooner caught
glimpses of the many islands that go to make up the
Thimble group.</p>

<p>Then, indistinctly, the main land came into view,
and at last the schooner came to anchor in the little
bay behind No Man's Island.</p>

<p>As the great sails were lowered, a shrill whistle
from the shore reached them. The captain answered
it promptly; and presently the sound of oars
working in rowlocks was heard.</p>

<p>"That's Pete Coffey," whispered Barney. Then,
as the boat came into view, "I wonder who he's got
with him?"</p>

<p>No one spoke again until the boat was alongside
the schooner.</p>

<p>"Here, take the painter," called out Pete, "and
make it fast," and he threw the end of the rope on
board.</p>

<p>A sailor caught it and fastened it accordingly.</p>

<p>"Clarky," then said Pete to his companion in the
boat, "you stay here," and the next moment he
himself was on board the schooner.</p>

<p>He seemed astonished to see Barney and Bissell,
and looked upon Bunce with some show of suspicion.</p>

<p>"What's up with you fellows?" he asked. "And
who is this chap?"</p>

<p>"We've been driven out of New York, and have
got to skip the country," answered Barney.</p>

<p>"And the long and short of it is," Bissell hastened
to add, "you must find some safe place in
which to secrete us until the schooner is ready for
sea."</p>

<p>"Hum! I don't know about you, Mr. Bissell."</p>

<p>"Don't know about me! What do you mean,
sir?"</p>

<p>"I don't think it's particularly safe to have anything
to do with you. I've noticed that whoever
has worked with you, or for you, has been fetched
up with a round turn sooner or later, and that you
always get off scot-free."</p>

<p>"Come, come, Pete," said Barney hastily, "if
you've got any grudge against Emory, it's no time
to show it now, when we're all in serious trouble.
Just lay it aside till we're in smooth water again."</p>

<p>"Well, for your sake, Barney, I suppose I must
do what I can for the crowd; but I tell you what,
old fellow, it goes awfully against the grain to do
anything for that smooth-tongued traitor."</p>

<p>"Come, come, Pete," said Bissell, in his most
plausible tone, "if I've offended you in any way
I'm ready and willing to make it all right with you.
And now tell us, where can you put us for a night
and a day?"</p>

<p>"First, I want to know who this stranger is.
You'll please to remember that I haven't been introduced
to him yet."</p>

<p>"Excuse me, Pete," Barney hastened to say.
"It's Bill Bunce, a friend of mine; you've heard me
speak of him;" and then he explained how he happened
to be with them.</p>

<p>Pete heard him through to the end; then, with
some show of interest, he asked:</p>

<p>"Do I understand you to say that that slippery
Jew, Jake Klinkhammer, has really passed in his
checks at last?"</p>

<p>"Yes, poor Jake got something in his stomach
that he couldn't very well digest, and so he was
obliged to throw up the sponge."</p>

<p>"The deuce! whose turn will it be next, I wonder?
Do you know, Barney, they're after me, hot
and heavy, for that little job in the Stony Creek
railway station?"</p>

<p>"They are! But they can't fasten anything on to
you."</p>

<p>"I don't know about that; they've got half a
dozen men on my track, and if they can't find any
evidence against me, they'll manufacture some.
Leave the hounds alone for that."</p>

<p>"Is it really so bad, Pete?"</p>

<p>"You just bet it is. And, by the way, cap'n, one
thing I came out to say is, that for your sake, as
well as my own, I daresn't help you land the liquor
or store it away to-night."</p>

<p>"Thunder!" exclaimed the captain, "what'll I do,
then?"</p>

<p>"I've got two friends&mdash;safe fellows, who are
working in the quarry as a blind; they'll help you,
and do whatever I could do myself."</p>

<p>"Ah! but where are they now?"</p>

<p>"Waiting in my boat-house&mdash;you know the spot."</p>

<p>"Yes, where we usually land, ain't it?"</p>

<p>"That's the place."</p>

<p>"Well, is everything clear to get to work now?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I've given my regular attendants the slip
to-night, and you can go ahead with your work as
soon as you've a-mind to, and I'll go ahead with
mine. Now, then, gentlemen, I'm ready to pilot
you to a safe place whenever you're ready to accompany
me."</p>

<p>"We're ready now," said Barney, with alacrity.
"Let's get into the boat without a moment's delay."</p>

<p>"All right, jump in," and Barney quickly clambered
over the schooner's gunwale, and slipped
down into the boat.</p>

<p>"Are you sure it's safe for us to land&mdash;sure
there's no one on the lookout for us?" asked Bissell,
nervously.</p>

<p>"Sure as I can be of anything," answered Pete.
"At any rate, it's safer than it is for you to stay
here, so go ahead," and Bissell let himself down
into the boat, and was quickly followed by Bill
Bunce, Pete himself bringing up in the rear.</p>

<p>"Where's your togs, gentlemen?" asked Pete,
looking about the bottom of the boat as he took his
seat.</p>

<p>"What we managed to get away with, we've left
on board the schooner," answered Barney. "She
expects to get to sea to-morrow night, you know,
and we thought it wouldn't be worth while to
bring anything ashore for so short a time."</p>

<p>"All right, you ought to know best, but I can't fit
you all out with clean shirts and collars, understand."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't let that worry you, my good friend,"
said Bissell, with a good deal of effusion, "we will
excuse you, and do very well, I have no doubt."</p>

<p>Clarky remained silent&mdash;indeed, he hardly spoke
even when Pete addressed him, but worked away
at his oar as if his very life depended upon it.</p>

<p>Presently they reached the shore and landed.</p>

<p>Pete addressed a few words to Clarky in a low
tone, and then turning to his other companion,
said:</p>

<p>"All ready; come on," and at once started up a
narrow pathway, at some distance from the main
road.</p>

<p>Bissell, with some curiosity, looked back.</p>

<p>He saw Clarky haul the boat well up out of the
water and fasten it to a stake. He then saw him
start toward a little clump of trees, where the faint
outlines of a boat-house could just be seen.</p>

<p>Pete walked on rapidly, and it was all his
friends could do to keep up with him.</p>

<p>They kept on in this way for almost half an
hour, when they came to what appeared to be a
deserted stone-quarry.</p>

<p>Pete now turned to the left, and they skirted this
quarry for some distance until they came to a little
cluster of huts or shanties, most of them, like the
quarry, deserted.</p>

<p>One or two of the shanties were set well back
against a side hill, and into the largest of these Pete
conducted his companions.</p>

<p>The place contained two good-sized rooms, one a
general living-room, and the other a bedroom.</p>

<p>The first was empty, the other occupied, as was
evident, when a woman's voice, in querulous tones,
demanded to know who was there.</p>

<p>"It's me, Mag," answered Pete. "Don't fret
yourself."</p>

<p>"Don't fret myself! You uneasy, restless villain;
you're enough to fret a saint. What're you up to at
this time o' night, anyway? Why ain't ye at home
and in bed, where you ought to be?"</p>

<p>"I've got business to attend to, and some friends
to look after; I shall stow them away inside for
twenty-four hours. There's plenty of food in there,
I suppose?"</p>

<p>"I suppose there is. If there ain't there ought to
be, and that's all I know about it."</p>

<p>"And beds fit to sleep on?"</p>

<p>"How many is there with you?"</p>

<p>"Three."</p>

<p>"Then there are beds enough, so that each one
can have two. And now will you let me go to
sleep, Pete Coffey?"</p>

<p>"Yes, unless you want a little taste of the Bouncing
Betsey's West Indian rum."</p>

<p>"The Bouncing Betsey! West Indian rum, eh?
Bring it right here, Pete, like a good fellow."</p>

<p>"I'm coming, my dear."</p>

<p>"That's right, come on. Oh! a friend in need is
a friend indeed. I was just longing for some good,
pure spirits; and now, here you come to me, like an
angel of mercy!"</p>

<p>By this time Pete was in the bedroom and had
found his way to the side of the bed.</p>

<p>"Where is it, Pete?" asked the old woman, eagerly
stretching out her hand.</p>

<p>He handed her one of several bottles the captain
had given him just before he had got into his
boat.</p>

<p>She uncorked it and placed the nozzle to her lips;
then she took a good, long, hearty pull.</p>

<p>"There! let up!" exclaimed Pete, at last.</p>

<p>But it was hard to induce the old gal to take her
lips from the bottle after she had once got them
fastened to it.</p>

<p>Pete, understanding the situation, waited patiently,
and when at length she stopped to breathe,
drew the bottle gently away.</p>

<p>She resigned it with a sigh.</p>

<p>"Good-night, Mag. Sorry I can't leave it with
you," and Pete returned to those who were modestly
waiting in the other room.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV.</a></h2>

<p class="center">A SURPRISE PARTY.</p>


<p>Pete Coffey now took up a kerosene lamp and
some matches, but he did not strike a light.</p>

<p>He dropped down on his knees at the back of the
cabin, and ran his hand over the boards.</p>

<p>Presently he shoved one aside, and then another,
and another.</p>

<p>"Now, one of you come here," he said.</p>

<p>Barney was quickly at his side.</p>

<p>"Let me aim you right," said Pete, "and then
crawl ahead on your hands and knees for at least
twenty feet before you rise."</p>

<p>Barney started ahead, doing the "baby act" very
creditably.</p>

<p>"Come, Bissell, hurry up," said Pete, impatiently,
and dropping down beside him, Bissell endeavored
to peer into the black darkness beyond.</p>

<p>"What devil's hole is this?" he asked, suspiciously.</p>

<p>"It may be the devil's hole, as you say," answered
Pete. "In fact, I have sometimes thought it was
myself. At all events, the devil takes better care
of his own in there than I've ever known him to do
anywhere else; and so, if you really want to escape
your enemies, you'd better be getting in, for I don't
propose to fool all my time away on you to-night, I
can tell you."</p>

<p>Bissell followed after Barney without another
word.</p>

<p>Bill Bunce needed no admonition. He had been
familiar with dark holes for the better part of his
life, and had a particularly friendly feeling for
them, and so he followed on after Bissell, keeping
close behind him.</p>

<p>Pete, as soon as there was room for him to do
so, entered the hole, and having carefully replaced
the boards he had slipped aside, lighted his lamp,
and holding it up to the roof of the low tunnel,
cast its rays ahead, so that Barney could see when
it was safe for him to rise.</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed Barney, starting to his feet,
"this is something like a hiding place."</p>

<p>The rays of Pete's light had shown him an extensive
cavern, hollowed out of the granite rock, of
which all that portion of the New England coast is
composed.</p>

<p>Speedily he was joined by his companions, and a
hasty examination of the chamber took place.</p>

<p>It was large enough to contain twenty or thirty
men, and there were accommodations for at least a
dozen. The place was also supplied with edibles,
and Pete hinted that there was something stronger
than water stowed away in one dark recess, "of
which, thank God, old Mag knew nothing."</p>

<p>"If she did, I reckon it wouldn't be there long,"
laughed Barney.</p>

<p>"That's it, the old gal hasn't many failings, but
one of 'em is an over-fondness for hard stuff."</p>

<p>After some time spent in talking over the situation,
Pete intimated that the travelers might like to
get a little rest, and said he would go out and reconnoiter.</p>

<p>The lamp had been placed on a projecting piece
of rock that served as a shelf, and with only his
knowledge of the place to guide him, Pete started
for the entrance.</p>

<p>He could not have had more than time enough to
reach the cabin, when the sound of excited voices
came back to the fugitives through the tunnel,
which served the purpose of a speaking tube.</p>

<p>"Seized? the Bouncing Betsey seized? By whom,
in the demon's name?"</p>

<p>It was Pete who asked the question, there could be
no doubt of that.</p>

<p>"Yes, Pete, she was taken in less than twenty
minutes after you left her," answered another
voice.</p>

<p>"That's the fellow he called Clarky," whispered
Bissell to his companions.</p>

<p>The others nodded.</p>

<p>"But by whom&mdash;by whom was she taken?" demanded
Pete, impatiently.</p>

<p>"Revenue officers; and there are three or four
detectives with them."</p>

<p>"The deuce! this looks black."</p>

<p>"I guess you'll think so when you know the
rest."</p>

<p>"What is the rest? Tell me without any further
loss of time."</p>

<p>"Those detectives are sharper than the devil;
they went through everything on board the
schooner in less than no time, and it didn't take
'em long to find the passengers' duds."</p>

<p>"Ah! I thought it might come to that. Blamed
fools, they ought to have brought 'em ashore. But
did they recognize 'em?"</p>

<p>"You just bet they did. There was a bean-pole
sort of a fellow among 'em, and he says, says he,
'These things belong to Barney Hawks; he wore
'em the night after Margaret Ernst was murdered.
And those belong to Bill Bunce; he had 'em on in
his saloon the day of the fight there.' 'And these,'
said another old fellow, 'are Emory Bissell's: see,
here's his name; there's no getting away from that.'"</p>

<p>"Thunder and blazes!" hissed Bissell, "why were
we such confounded fools as to leave such evidence
of our presence on board the schooner?"</p>

<p>"Simply because we <i>are</i> confounded fools," returned
Barney; "nothing more or less. But listen:
let us know the worst."</p>

<p>"Come, do get out o' here, an' let an old woman
get a little sleep. Into the cavern with you, or outdoors&mdash;I
don't care which."</p>

<p>It was evident Pete and Clarky had been joined
by old Mag.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, Mag, and then we'll be off," said
Pete, in a conciliatory tone. "Have the detectives
any idea, Clarky, where the fugitives have gone to?"</p>

<p>"Can't say as to that; but I tell you that thin fellow
is an awful knowing chap."</p>

<p>"But, see here, man, how comes it that you know
so much about the matter? Did you go aboard the
schooner again?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I took those bottles up to the boathouse
and hid them as you told me; then I had a few
words to say to our boys there, when the cap'n came
ashore and wanted us all to help him land his goods,
so I took a hand and went aboard with him. Then
the officers came, and as soon as I could I slipped
out to let you know what was in the wind."</p>

<p>"Come into the cavern, we must talk this over
with Barney and his friends," and a little later they
were heard crawling through the passage.</p>

<p>The first question Bissell put when they had
joined them was:</p>

<p>"Is there any one living who knows of the existence
of this place who would give the knowledge
away to the detectives?"</p>

<p>"Not one," answered Pete, promptly.</p>

<p>"Then, as the schooner is taken," said Bissell,
"we must stay here till you get a chance to ship us
on board some other West Indian craft."</p>

<p>"That won't work, so far as Pete is concerned,"
put in Clarky, abruptly.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"He is to be arrested to-night himself."</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"Heard it talked up. They've found out that
Way was killed in the station while he was in the
act of sending off a telegraph message, that he was
struck down from behind, then robbed, and his
body placed on the track to be mutilated; they
have also found out that Pete was around the station
at about that time, with some others, and so
they are going to take him, and I reckon if it
don't turn out a swinging affair for him, he will at
least get boarding accommodations up the river for
the rest of his life."</p>

<p>"Hum, it does look a little that way, by Jove!"
muttered Pete.</p>

<p>"Well, then," said Bissell, "Pete must stay here
with us, and we must depend on you, Clarky, to
help us out when the time comes."</p>

<p>"On me? By thunder! I don't know but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But that you are in as bad a box as the rest, eh,
young man?"</p>

<p>It was a calm and matter-of-fact voice that uttered
these words, and every man in the cavern
sprung to his feet as he heard them, with exclamations
of consternation on his lips.</p>

<p>Then they saw the tall, thin form of Old Spicer
towering over them, and just behind him, four or
five more detectives, all thoroughly armed and
ready for business!</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.</a></h2>

<p class="center">CONCLUSION.</p>


<p>"Take it quietly, gentlemen, I beg," said Old
Spicer, in his usual tones. "The jig's up. I acknowledge
that you have shown a good deal of skill
and made us some trouble; but we've got you now,
like so many rats in a trap."</p>

<p>"By Jove! you shall never take me alive, Mark
Spicer," exclaimed Bissell, fiercely.</p>

<p>"Very well, I shall take you dead, then, Emory
Bissell," was the calm reply. "For, above all, <i>you</i>
must not escape. God alone can calculate the evil
you have done. You have brought ruin and death
upon Charley Way, you have made a miserable
woman of his widow for life, you have corrupted and
involved in the general ruin Pete Coffey here, and
many of his associates, you are responsible for the
Ernst murder and for the blasted lives of Henry
Chamberlain and Frank Taylor."</p>

<p>"And you'd better add," interrupted Bissell, with
savage glee, "that I have had my reward in the
knowledge that I have brought eternal misery on
one that I'll never name, who has an interest in Hen
Chamberlain, and who, with me and one or two
others, alone knows the mystery of his life."</p>

<p>"That triumph will yet turn to gall in your memory,"
said Old Spicer, sternly. "And now surrender
quietly, for we have much to do to-night. Seth,
you and George go forward and put on the bracelets.
If any one of them makes a hostile demonstration
we'll shoot him on the spot."</p>

<p>Seth Strickett and George Morgan stepped forward.</p>

<p>"Barney&mdash;Bill Bunce&mdash;Pete&mdash;Clarky, will you be
taken and strung up like so many slaughtered hogs?
Stand by me, now, and fight to the death!" and
whipping out a revolver, he fired point-blank at
Old Spicer's heart.</p>

<p>But the attenuated detective was not a very good
mark for a weak and excited man to aim at, and so
the ball sped by, and the next instant a howl went
up, as though all the witches of Macbeth were yelling
in concert.</p>

<p>"I'm killed&mdash;I'm murdered&mdash;I'm done for! Oh,
Lord! just let me get at the villain that fired that
shot and I'll tear his heart out!" Then, with another
yell, Old Mag dashed forward, and with the
blood streaming from a wound in her breast, threw
herself upon Bissell.</p>

<p>Barney and his friends seeing the confusion, now
attempted to escape.</p>

<p>The attempt was useless. But their blood was up
and they made a hard fight for it. Pistol reports
echoed and re-echoed through the vaulted cavern,
and to one standing by it would have seemed as
though two regiments were fighting.</p>

<p>At length it was over, and Old Spicer, who, fortunately,
had escaped uninjured, began to sum up
the results.</p>

<p>Emory Bissell was dead&mdash;killed by old Mag, who
lay gasping out her life by his side.</p>

<p>Barney Hawks was also dead; no less than three
bullets had entered his body, any one of which
would have finished him.</p>

<p>Bill Bunce was severely wounded and a prisoner.</p>

<p>Pete Coffey and Clarky surrendered when they
saw there was no use in holding out longer.</p>

<p>On the side of the law, one local officer was killed
and another badly wounded. Adam Killett and
Seth Stricket were also slightly hurt.</p>

<p>Pete Coffey and Clarky were placed in the local
lock-up, and the New York reporter, who was on
hand in the village, but who had not got an inkling
of what was going on at the bay, or up in the cavern,
was, at his own request, locked up with Pete
as a prisoner, in order to wheedle a full confession
out of him.</p>

<p>His efforts were not rewarded with a very brilliant
success.</p>

<p>Old Spicer, Stricket, and Morgan returned to New
Haven, well pleased with all that had been accomplished.</p>

<p>Killett, after obtaining a requisition from the
governor, took his prisoner, Bill Bunce, to New
York; but two days later he died in the Tombs.</p>

<p>With almost unprecedented speed the trial of
Chamberlain came on, and Cora Bell appeared
against him.</p>

<p>Her evidence, and other facts brought out by Old
Spicer and the New York detectives, was so overwhelming
that he was brought in guilty after a trial
of less than five days; but owing to his youth and
the fact that the murder was not actually premeditated,
he escaped the gallows.</p>

<p>Taylor's trial followed Chamberlain's, and as it
was evident he had been led into the scrape by the
latter, and had been so ready to confess, he got off
much easier than his friend.</p>

<p>Cora Bell conducted herself very well from first
to last during the trials, and so worked upon the
feelings of a susceptible young man that soon after
it was all over, he offered her his heart and hand.</p>

<p>She promptly accepted, and they are now living
very pleasantly together as man and wife.</p>

<p>Before the trial came on, Sadie Seaton strangely
disappeared from the city, and has never since been
heard of. Old Spicer, to satisfy his own curiosity,
thinks of looking her up later.</p>

<p>Peter Coffey's trial has not yet been called; but
the knowing ones declare that Clarky's prophecy is
pretty sure to be fulfilled. Clarky himself has been
released without bail.</p>

<p>Most of Mrs. Ernst's property has been recovered,
and the heirs under her will, including August Tepley,
are likely soon to benefit substantially by her
sudden death.</p>

<p>Adam Killett, and his trusty friends, Stark and
Rouse, are busy on a new case in New York. While
Old Spicer, whose world-wide fame debars him from
any rest, has just received orders to ferret out a dangerous
gang of smugglers and murderers who, for
some time past, have eluded the vigilance of the constituted
authorities along the northern shores of Long
Island Sound.</p>

<p>Of course his old friend Seth Stricket, and his
adopted son, George Morgan, will assist him in his
new undertaking.</p>

great telegraph corporation. It will be found to
be a highly interesting book.</p>

<p><b>55. THE REPORTER DETECTIVE.</b>&mdash;Few persons,
not connected with the police department,
have such opportunity for detective work as a

Detective is a man who thoroughly understands

nefarious deeds. A splendid story of life in the
great metropolis.</p>

<p><b>70. DRUSCOVICH, THE RUSSIAN DETECTIVE.</b>&mdash;Another
story of a foreign detective.

the other. Begin the series with this splendid
story.</p>

<p><b>85. STONEWALL, THE ATHLETE DETECTIVE.</b>&mdash;"Stonewall"
is the <i>sobriquet</i> of a

and brilliant achievements have formed the
basis of many a detective story. This one will be

<p><b>86. THE RAILROAD DETECTIVE.</b>&mdash;Nowhere
is detective ingenuity more necessary than in the
great railroad systems which honeycomb the country.

be his greatest trail. All of Old Hawkeye's friends
will be sure to read this book.</p>

<p><b>92. OLD BROADBRIM, THE QUAKER DETECTIVE.</b>&mdash;This
is the first of a series of detective
stories in which the celebrated Philadelphia
detective known as Old Broadbrim takes an active
part. No one looking at the mild-mannered
Quaker would suspect that he was one of the
shrewdest detectives on any force. His cases were
many and very complicated, and after reading the
one developed in this book, you will want to read
them all.</p>

<p><b>93. DIAMOND DAN, THE BROOKLYN DETECTIVE.</b>&mdash;The
City of Brooklyn has furnished
some good men for the secret service, and among
the best of them will be found Diamond Dan.
Brooklyn boys will meet an old friend in the hero
of this story, and the boys of other cities will be
equally glad to make his acquaintance.</p>

<p><b>98. THE SARATOGA DETECTIVE.</b>&mdash;The
famous watering-place, the summer resort of so
many millionaires, naturally attracts the light-fingered
gentry. Many valuable diamonds have
been stolen from the hotels and cottages, and a
shrewd detective is always on guard to protect
the property of the guests. One of the most mysterious
of these robberies was tracked to a successful
issue by the detective in this story. It is well
worth buying the book to see how it was accomplished.</p>

<p><b>101. POLICE INSPECTOR HAWK.</b>&mdash;This
story is written by one of the best detective writers
in this country, and an intimate friend of the inspector,
whose brave deeds are recorded in its
pages. The reader may therefore be assured that
this story is based on facts, marvelous as the incidents
may appear to be. It is one of the best
stories in the <span class="smcap">Old Cap. Collier Library</span>.</p>

<p><b>102. TRACKED BY LIGHTNING.</b>&mdash;Many detectives
have admitted the fact that they were
often materially assisted in their work by freaks
of nature. In this story the detective owed part
of his success at least to the peculiar action of a
flash of lightning. What that action was and how
it aided the detective in his work may be learned
by a perusal of this great story.</p>

<p><b>103. THE COLD GULCH MYSTERY.</b>&mdash;Another
fascinating story of the Wild West. It
introduces cowboys, brigands, miners, explorers,
and other characters peculiar to California life.
Just the kind of a story to please the boys.</p>

<p><b>104. OLD MAN MARTIN.</b>&mdash;Old Man Martin was
a character in his day. Quiet and unostentatious,
no one suspected him of being a detective until
he came down on him like a shot. Then a criminal
might as well throw up his hands, as the old

<p><b>214. OLD RAFFERTY'S RIVAL.</b>&mdash;A humorous

envious of Old Rafferty's fame, starts in
to "down" the old man. It goes without saying
that he gets the worst of it. Full of startling adventures,
as well as comic situations.</p>

<p><b>216. OLD RAFFERTY ON HIS OWN HOOK.</b>&mdash;In
this excellent story Old Rafferty follows out

alone. The result is that he simply paralyzes his
detractors. One of the best books in the series.</p>

entirely different plot and different set of characters.
Only, Old Rafferty appears in all of them.
Each one can be read singly with equal enjoyment,
but we advise all to buy and read the whole
series.</p>

<p><b>228. MUNSON, THE DETROIT DETECTIVE.</b>&mdash;Detroit,
being so near the Canadian border,
is often used as the headquarters of gangs of
smugglers, who seek to defraud Uncle Sam of his
custom duties. Munson spots several of this
gang in the course of this story, and runs them
down. An exciting and lively detective tale.</p>

<p><b>238. MONTE-CRISTO IN NEW YORK.</b>&mdash;It
is said that the most improbable imaginings of
fiction are often duplicated in real life. This
story is an example of this fact. When Alexander
Dumas wrote his famous story he little imagined
that right here in the city of New York a young
man would actually go through a similar ordeal as
Edmond Dante's. Such, however, is the fact, and
this story gives the full history of it, just as it was
related by the New York Monte-Cristo to the
author himself. The story is, naturally enough,
exciting and interesting from beginning to end.</p>

<p><b>240. THE GREAT TRUNK MYSTERY.</b>&mdash;This
is the true story, never before published, of
the famous St. Louis Tragedy, in which the victim
was murdered, his mutilated body packed in a
trunk, and shipped away by express. It is illustrated
with actual portraits of the principals, the
witnesses, and the detectives in the case, and also
sketches of the different localities, taken by artists
on the spot.</p>

<p><b>260. OLD PITCHER, THE BASE BALL
DETECTIVE.</b>&mdash;As long as the grass grows and
water flows the American youth will not lose his
love for and interest in the national game. Anything
connected with base ball has a particular
interest for him, and, therefore, a good base ball
detective story is sure to be appreciated. Old
Pitcher, the hero, is an old-time ball player who
has become a detective, and finds that the muscular
development of the game stands him in good
stead in his new profession. A number of incidents
in the book take place on the "diamond,"
and appeal powerfully to every admirer of the best
and most wholesome sport ever invented.</p>

<p><b>269. THE CALIFORNIA DETECTIVE.</b>&mdash;A
rattling good story of life on the Pacific Coast.
The California Detective is a thoroughbred, and
cuts a clean swath among the brigands, road-agents,
desperadoes, "greasers," gamblers and
black-legs, which infest the El Dorado of the
West. Every chapter in this story contains an exciting
episode and the climaxes are intensely
dramatic.</p>

<p><b>271. THE CALIFORNIA DETECTIVE IN
WALL STREET.</b>&mdash;A companion story to the
foregoing, by the same author. In this story,
Old Sam, the California Detective, comes on East
and gives the crooks and sharps in Wall Street
something to remember him by. The way he converts
the New York Stock Exchange into a section
of the Wild West is a caution to behold. Don't
fail to read these two great stories.</p>

<p><b>305. OLD CAP. COLLIER'S SCHOOL.</b>&mdash;Again
Old Cap. Collier jumps into harness and does some
of his fine old-time work. The old man is as
sprightly and active as ever, yet he thinks it best
to train two young lads in the way all good detectives
should go. These lads accompany him on
all his "pipings," and by their activity and intelligence
gladden the heart of the old master.</p>

<p><b>309. ESCAPED FROM SING SING.</b>&mdash;A thrilling
story of the daring escape of a convict who
had been immured in the state prison for a crime
of which he was wholly innocent. Securing his
liberty in a most exciting and ingenious way, the
hero turns detective on his own case, while the
regular detectives are trying to recapture him. He
not only succeeds in balking their plans, but in
establishing his innocence and securing a full pardon.
